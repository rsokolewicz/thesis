This thesis would not be possible without the help and support from colleagues, friends and family. Playing music on Fridays, the Seinfeld video of the day. Secretly keeping track of who entered our office and performing data analysis on it with \emph{Guus} (\emph{Lennert} won by most visits). What started as the daily coffee break with \emph{Matteo} and \emph{Alessandro}, was taken over by \emph{Achille} and \emph{Andrei}. Walking to work with \emph{Josien}. The daily zig-zag walks with \emph{Sanne}. Frequent discussions with \emph{Matthieu} about Magic the Gathering, politics, economy and any other topic. Complaining with \emph{Taha} that our code never seems to work.
%Akwardly waving at \emph{Marion} every day. Discussing inappropriate things with \emph{Marion}. Acting crazy together with \emph{Marion} ("beeeuh").
The vodka parties at \emph{Jaap}'s place. \emph{Marion} drunkenly shouting Russian curse words at \emph{Sergei} Brenner in front of his daughter and wife. The times we played counter strike on Friday afternoon. 
%The time \emph{Lennert} \emph{Guus} and \emph{I} did a Monkey Island speed run and I lost miserably because I couldn't remember how to get the Jawbreaker from Cuthroat Bill.
Writing and sharing RefterPy so you can check the refter menu from the terminal. \emph{Bektur} exercising in the office to keep his focus up. Dancing with \emph{Askar}. Regretting hiking Glacier 3000 in Diablerets, Switzerland together with \emph{Misha Baglai} wearing only flip-flops. The time \emph{Zhenya} invited me to spend winter holidays in Moscow at -27 degrees. The time when \emph{Roel} and \emph{Ragnar} barged in my office singing happy birthday. After work burgers with \emph{Ruben} and \emph{Matthieu} at the HAN student canteen. \emph{Majka} giving me surprise hugs. Random coffee breaks with \emph{Thom}, lunch and dinners with \emph{Marion}. Casual visits by \emph{Bram}. %Discussing with \emph{Guus} how we could show each other something on our screens without standing up.
The yearly Sinterklaas celebration at TCM. The time when one of the \emph{Sasha}'s ate one of the presents, leaving $N-1$ gifts for $N$ people. The time another \emph{Sasha} asked if it is illegal to call the police after he was told to stop reporting the woman with a beard he saw on the street. \emph{Misha Katsnelson}'s stories about soviet times during the coffee breaks and lunches. The awkward silences during some of the weekly department cake breaks. The time \emph{Bob} saved \emph{Sanne} and \emph{I} with his banana we could use to bake cookies in the department's kitchen. All the times \emph{I} baked brownies and apple pies. The time \emph{Ivan} shared a story where he retrieved his stolen hard drive from the Camorra. All the times when \emph{Koen} effortlessly shows his communication skills in 4.5 different languages. Playing jianzi with \emph{Edo}, \emph{Peilang}, \emph{Jin}, \emph{Guodong} and \emph{Amanda}. \emph{Erik} who forgot to put me in his acknowledgement. Random games of chess with \emph{Peilang}, \emph{Misha}, and \emph{Askar}. \emph{Hylke} being the first to join for Friday afternoon drinks. The time all participants of a summer school in Moscow ended up with food poisoning. Sharing craft-beer enthusiasm with \emph{Dima}. Ice skating with \emph{Mariana}, tennis with \emph{Lisa}. 
% The time we built a five meter snow-penis in front of \emph{Zhenya}'s office.
%The time \emph{Lennert}, \emph{Erik}, \emph{Edo} and \emph{I} took an afternoon off to play a 3 hour game of Shogun.
The time I organised a TCM movie-night and we ended up playing counter strike instead. The many times we shot lengthy goodbye videos for graduating PhD students. 

And of course, spending the last two months of my PhD in lock-down with my sweet and lovely girlfriend, \emph{Lan}.
