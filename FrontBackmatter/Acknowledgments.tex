I have many fond memories working at the theory of condensed matter department, a place that often felt like a second home to me. Playing music on Fridays, the Seinfeld video of the day. Secretly keeping track of who entered our office and performing data analysis on it with \emph{Guus} (\emph{Lennert} won by most visits). What started as the daily coffee break with \emph{Matteo} and \emph{Alessandro}, was taken over by \emph{Achille} and \emph{Andrei}. Walking to work with \emph{Josien}. The daily zig-zag walks with \emph{Sanne}. Sharing weekend stories with \emph{Belinda}. Frequent discussions with \emph{Matthieu} about Magic: The Gathering, politics, economy and any other topic. Complaining with \emph{Taha} that our code never seems to work.
%Akwardly waving at \emph{Marion} every day. Discussing inappropriate things with \emph{Marion}. Acting crazy together with \emph{Marion} ("beeeuh").
The vodka parties at \emph{Jaap}'s place. \emph{Marion} drunkenly shouting Russian curse words at \emph{Brenner} in front of his daughter and wife. The times we played counter strike on Friday afternoon. The time \emph{Andre Bagrov} complained that the menu at caf\'e de Plak had only two meat options. 
%The time \emph{Lennert} \emph{Guus} and \emph{I} did a Monkey Island speed run and I lost miserably because I couldn't remember how to get the Jawbreaker from Cuthroat Bill.
Writing and sharing RefterPy so you can check the Refter menu from the terminal. The time \emph{Tom} accidentally used up all the computational budget at Cartesius without saving any of his data. \emph{Bektur} exercising in the office to keep his focus up. Dancing with \emph{Askar}. Regretting hiking Glacier 3000 in Diablerets, Switzerland together with \emph{Misha Baglai} wearing only flip-flops. The time \emph{Zhenya} invited me to spend winter holidays in Moscow at -27 degrees. The time when \emph{Roel} and \emph{Ragnar} barged in my office singing happy birthday. After-work burgers with \emph{Ruben} and \emph{Matthieu} at the HAN student canteen. \emph{Majka} giving me surprise hugs. Random coffee breaks with \emph{Thom}, lunch and dinners with \emph{Marion}. Casual visits by \emph{Bram}. %Discussing with \emph{Guus} how we could show each other something on our screens without standing up.
Discussing data privacy and many other topics with \emph{Arthur}. \emph{Annalisa}'s tiramisu. The yearly Sinterklaas celebration at TCM, in particular the time when one of the \emph{Sasha}s ate one of the presents, leaving $N-1$ gifts for $N$ people. The time another \emph{Sasha} asked if it is illegal to call the police after he was told to stop reporting the woman with a beard he saw on the street. \emph{Misha Katsnelson}'s stories about Soviet times during the coffee breaks and lunches. The countless stories of \emph{Misha Titov} involving near-death experiences, Russian aluminum mafia and children-gangs of Krasnoyarsk. The awkward silences during some of the weekly department cake breaks. The time \emph{Bob} saved \emph{Sanne} and \emph{I} with his banana we could use to bake cookies in the department's kitchen. 
% All the times \emph{I} baked brownies and apple pies.
The time \emph{Ivan} retrieved his stolen hard drive from the Camorra. All the times when \emph{Koen} effortlessly shows his communication skills in 4.5 different languages. Playing jianzi with \emph{Edo}, \emph{Peilang}, \emph{Jin}, \emph{Guodong} and \emph{Amanda}. Discussing TikZ with \emph{Erik}. 
%Random games of chess with \emph{Peilang}, \emph{Misha Titov}, and \emph{Askar}.
Dressing up as pikachu to make a PhD video for \emph{Remko}. \emph{Hylke} being the first to join for Friday afternoon drinks. The time all participants of a summer school in Moscow ended up with food poisoning. Sharing craft-beer enthusiasm with \emph{Dima}. Ice skating with \emph{Mariana}, tennis with \emph{Lisa}. The time \emph{Manuel} took over my apartment. The time I randomly met \emph{Michel}, \emph{Clement}'s best friend, in a bar in Leiden.

%The time \emph{Lennert}, \emph{Erik}, \emph{Edo} and \emph{I} took an afternoon off to play a 3 hour game of Shogun.

Outside of work, many good times could be found as well. The time \emph{Andre}, \emph{Matteo} and \emph{I} surprised \emph{Samy} in Toulouse. Sunday evening board game nights. The time \emph{Dave}, \emph{Cas}, \emph{Clarisse} and \emph{Jos} pushed me to join a cooking show when I was hungover.
