PMA:
spin-orbit coupling not only connects the spin with the orbital moment of the electron, it also connects the magnetization direction to the crystal lattice giving rise to magnetocrystalline anisotropy \cite{hellman_interface-induced_2017}.

the fundamental origin being the anisotropy of the
interfacial orbital angular momentum induced by the lowered
symmetry (Gay and Richter, 1986; Daalderop, Kelly, and
Schuurmans, 1994; Weller et al., 1995; St√∂hr, 1999)

leading to an unequal change
in the occupied density of states for spin up and spin down
bands, thus altering the interfacial magnetization (Rondinelli,
Stengel, and Spaldin, 2008).

Furthermore, in crystals lacking inversion symmetry, spin-orbit coupling together with exchange interaction can lead to Dzyaloshinksy-Moriya interaction \cite{moriya_new_1960, moriya_anisotropic_1960, dzyaloshinsky_thermodynamic_1958}. Systems lacking dzyaloshinksi-moriya interaction can still exhibit chiral magnetism \cite{ado_chiral_2020}.

spin currents
This statement is valid even though the notions of spin-angular-momentum
transfer and spin current are imprecise because spin-orbit
coupling is always present, making it difficult to rigorously
define the spin current across an interface, and partially
renormalizing the spin-current torque \cite{nunez_theory_2006}.

spin hall enhancement by Pt Ta W
Although the direct and inverse spin Hall effects were
originally discovered experimentally in semiconductors the
effect is maximized for nonmagnetic heavy metals such as Pt,
Ta, or W with large spin-orbit coupling. 

To date, the strongest spin-orbit generated torques, and the ones most readily incorporated into
practical device designs, have been measured in bilayers of
one material with strong spin-orbit interactions that generates a pure spin current, and a second ferromagnetic layer whose
magnetization direction can be controlled by this spin current

A feasible scheme to spintronically control the magnetization of vdW magnets is
to combine their PMA with the effect of SOTs, by employing an additional heavy
metal layer next to the magnetic layer

A feasible scheme to spintronically control the magnetization of
vdW magnets is to combine their PMA with the effect of SOTs, using
an additional heavy metal layer next to the magnetic layer. 

There are two classes of mechanisms that can lead to
the generation of spin torques from spin-orbit interactions in
such samples: three-dimensional (3D) bulk mechanisms such
as the spin Hall effect already discussed, and 2D (interfacial)
mechanisms that produce an inverse spin galvanic effect,
commonly known as the Edelstein (sometimes RashbaEdelstein) effect.
