To me it sounds like it has little to do with a central earth. Hubble sees the following possibilities:

(i) The universe is uniform and the red shift occurs due to the nebula moving away from us, implying that the universe is expanding everywhere.  
(ii) The universe is uniform and the red shift occurs due to unknown physics. This doesn't require the universe to expand everywhere. 
(iii) The universe is not uniform and all nebula move away from us.

You seem to argue that the reason Hubble gave up on option (iii) is because he was an atheist. He uses strong language and (iii) has religious consequence. Therefore rejecting (iii) must be evidence of his atheism. But I don't see why choosing (iii) would favour any religious believe? He mentions the central earth hypothesis only once

> But we would not expect to find a distribution in which the density increases with distance, symmetrically in all directions. Such a condition would imply that we occupy a unique position in the universe, analogous, in a sense, to the ancient conception of a central earth. 

but he doesn't touch religion at all here. He refers to the central earth as "ancient", probably refering to the ancient Greeks. 

Hubble's spends a lot of time motivating the uniformity of the universe, rather than saying anything related to religion. Hubble mentions how the density of nebula must be constant and that the nebula moving away from us **only locally** contradicts the constantness of the nebula density. Therefore number (iii) must be dismissed. 

again, the entire reasoning is not motivated by any religious standpoint.
