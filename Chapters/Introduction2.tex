Ferromagnetic spintronics has greatly contributed to microelectronic technology in the last few decades \cite{bader_spintronics_2010, sinova_new_2012, bhatti_spintronics_2017}. One of the practical results was the development of magnetic memories with purely electronic write-in and read-out processes as an alternative to existing solid state drive technologies \cite{kent_new_2015, sato_two-terminal_2018}.

Ferromagnetic thin films have already entered commercial use in hard drives, magnetic field and rotation angle sensors and in similar devices  \cite{Parkin2003,Jogschies2015,Novoselov2019}, while keeping high promises for technologically competitive ultrafast memory elements \cite{Lau2016} and neuromorphic chips \cite{Fukami2016}. 

A gapless character of the spin-wave spectrum in isotropic Heisenberg magnets in two dimensions results in the homogeneity of magnetic ordering being destroyed by thermal fluctuations at any finite temperatures. In contrast, in van der Waals magnets, characterized by intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy that stems from spin-orbit coupling \cite{Lado2017}, an ordered magnetic state can be retained down to a monolayer limit. Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets are currently experiencing a revived attention \cite{Gong2017,Herrero2017,Burch2018,Tokmachev2018,Gong2019,Novoselov2019,Cortie2019} driven by the prospects of gateable magnetism \cite{Huang2018,Shengwei2018,Wang2018,Deng2018}, a continuing search for Kitaev materials \cite{Nagler2019,Gordon2019} and Majorana fermions \cite{Livanas2019}, topologically driven phenomena \cite{Mokrousov2019} as well as various applications \cite{Herrero2017,Burch2018,Novoselov2019}. The trade-off between quantum confinement, nontrivial topology and long-range magnetic correlations determines their unique magnetoelectronic properties, in particular a tunable tunneling conductance \cite{Wang2018a} and magnetoresistance \cite{Song2018,Klein2018,Kim2018} depending on the number of layers in the sample, as well as long-distance magnon transport \cite{Xing2019}.
