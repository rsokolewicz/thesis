    abstract = "{Based on the $s$--$d$ interaction model for dilute magnetic alloys we have calculated the scattering probability of the conduction electrons to the second Born approximation. Because of the dynamical character of the localized spin system, the Pauli principle should be taken into account in the intermediate states of the second order terms. Thus the effect of the Fermi sphere is involved in the scattering probability and gives rise to a singular term in the resistivity which involves c log T as a factor, where c is the concentration of impurity atoms. When combined with the lattice resistivity, this gives rise to a resistance minimum, provided the $s$--$d$ exchange integral J is negative. The temperature at which the minimum ccurs is proportional to c1/5 and the depth of the minimum to c, as is observed. The predicted log T dependence is tested with available experiments and is confirmed. The value of J to have fit with experiments is about -0.2 ev, which is of reasonable magnitude. Our conclusion is that J should be negative in alloys which show a resistance minimum. It is argued that the resistance minimum is a result of the sharp Fermi surface.}",

	abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.}

These topological properties are the natural generalizations of the time reversal-breaking quantum Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions. The TRI quantum spin Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions and the topological insulator in 3+1 dimensions can be obtained as descendants from the fundamental TRI insulator in 4+1 dimensions through a dimensional reduction procedure. The effective topological field theory and the Z2 topological classification for the TRI insulators in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions are naturally obtained from this procedure. All physically measurable topological response functions of the TRI insulators are completely described by the effective topological field theory. Our effective topological field theory predicts a number of measurable phenomena, the most striking of which is the topological magnetoelectric effect, where an electric field generates a topological contribution to the magnetization in the same direction, with a universal constant of proportionality quantized in odd multiples of the fine-structure constant $\alpha =e^2/\hbar c$. Finally, we present a general classification of all topological insulators in various dimensions and describe them in terms of a unified topological Chern-Simons field theory in phase space.},

 abstract = {We propose a model ferromagnet based on the Dirac Hamiltonian in three spatial dimensions, and study its transport properties which include anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and anomalous Hall (AH) effect. This relativistic extension allows two kinds of ferromagnetic order parameters, denoted by M and S, which are distinguished by the relative sign between the positive- and negative-energy states (at zero momentum) and become degenerate in the nonrelativistic limit. Because of the relativistic coupling between the spin and the orbital motion, both M and S induce anisotropic deformations of the energy dispersion (and the Fermi surfaces) but in mutually opposite ways. The AMR is determined primarily by the anisotropy of the Fermi surface (group velocity), and secondarily by the anisotropy of the damping; the latter becomes important for M=$\pm$S, where the Fermi surfaces are isotropic. Even when the chemical potential lies in the gap, the AH conductivity is found to take a finite nonquantized value $\sigma \_{ij}=$-$(\alpha /3\pi ^2\hbar )\epsilon \_{ijk}S\_k$, where $\alpha$ is the (effective) fine structure constant. This offers an example of Hall insulator in three spatial dimensions.},

We show analytically that the coupling between the magnetic domain wall and the TI removes the degeneracy of the wall profile with respect to its chirality and topological charge. Moreover, we find that the threshold for Walker breakdown of domain-wall motion is substantially increased and determined by the interaction with the TI, allowing for higher attainable wall velocities than in the conventional case where the hard-axis anisotropy determines the Walker threshold. Finally, we show that the allowed modes of spin-wave excitations and the ensuing magnetization dynamics in the presence of a TI coupling enable a magnonic torque acting even on homogeneous magnetization textures. Our results indicate that the TI-ferromagnet interaction has a similar effect on the magnetization dynamics as an intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in ferromagnets.},

Expressing exchange coupling between the localized magnetic moments and Dirac electrons in terms of the electrons' out-of-plane orbital and spin magnetizations, we relate the thermodynamic properties of a general ferromagnetic spin texture to the physics in the zeroth Landau level. Persistent currents carried by Dirac electrons endow the magnetic texture with a Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction, which exhibits a universal scaling form as a function of electron temperature, chemical potential, and the time-reversal symmetry breaking gap. In addition, the orbital motion of electrons establishes a direct magnetoelectric coupling between the unscreened electric field and local magnetic order, which furnishes complex long-ranged interactions within the magnetic film.},

We demonstrate the qualitatively different Dyaknov-Perel spin relaxation behavior between the TSSs and the two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling electron gas. The decay time of both in-plane and out-of-plane spin polarization is naturally proved to be identical to the charge transport time. The out-of-plane spin dynamics is shown to be in the experimentally reachable regime of the femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy and thereby we suggest experiments to detect the charge transport properties of the TSSs from their unique spin dynamics.},

Averaging S(r) over a few angstroms along the longitudinal direction defined by the current flow reveals a large component pointing in the transverse direction. In addition, we find an order of magnitude smaller out-of-plane component when the direction of injected current with respect to Bi and Se atoms probes the largest hexagonal warping of the Dirac-cone dispersion on the TI surface. Our analysis is based on an extension of the nonequilibrium Green's functions combined with density functional theory (NEGF+DFT) to situations involving noncollinear spins and spin-orbit coupling. We also demonstrate how DFT calculations with a properly optimized local orbital basis set can precisely match putatively more accurate calculations with a plane-wave basis set for the supercell of Bi2Se3.},

 abstract = {When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin--orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields. Bulk Bi1-xSbx single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states that are higher-dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator. In addition to its interesting boundary states, the bulk of Bi1-xSbx is predicted to exhibit three-dimensional Dirac particles, another topic of heightened current interest following the new findings in two-dimensional graphene and charge quantum Hall fractionalization observed in pure bismuth. However, despite numerous transport and magnetic measurements on the Bi1-xSbx family since the 1960s, no direct evidence of either topological Hall states or bulk Dirac particles has been found. Here, using incident-photon-energy-modulated angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (IPEM-ARPES), we report the direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of Bi0.9Sb0.1, locate the Kramers points at the sample's boundary and provide a comprehensive mapping of the Dirac insulator's gapless surface electron bands. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the 'topological metal'. They also suggest that this material has potential application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices that may incorporate 'light-like' bulk carriers and spin-textured surface currents.},

 abstract = {We theoretically study electrical responses of magnetization in Weyl semimetals. The Weyl semimetal is a new class of topological semimetals, possessing hedgehog type spin textures in momentum space. Because of this peculiar spin texture, an interplay of electron transport and spin dynamics might provide new method to electrical control of magnetization. In this paper, we consider the magnetically doped Weyl semimetals, and systematically study current- and charge-induced spin torque exerted on the local magnetization in three-dimensional Dirac-Weyl metals. We determine all current-induced spin torques including spin-orbit torque, spin-transfer torque, and the so-called \$\beta\$-term, up to first order with respect to spatial and temporal derivation and electrical currents. We find that spin-transfer torque and \$\beta\$-term are absent while spin-orbit torque is proportional to the axial current density. We also calculate the charge-induced spin torque microscopically. We find the charge-induced spin torque originates from the chiral anomaly due to the correspondence between spin operators and axial current operators in our model.},

We find that various types of spin vortices are imprinted on the surface of the TI depending on the spin and orbital angular momentum of the incident light. The key mechanism for the appearance of the unconventional spin structure is the spin-momentum locking in the surface state of the TI. Besides, the diffusive transport of electrons under an inhomogeneous electric field causes a gradient of the charge density, which then induces nonlocal charge current and spin density as well as the spin current. We discuss the relation between these quantities within the linear response to the applied electric field using the Keldysh-Green's function method.},

We will discuss a novel interferometer for Majorana fermions, which probes their Z2 phase. This setup also allows the transmission of neutral Majorana fermions through a point contact to be measured. We introduce a point contact formed by a superconducting junction and show that its transmission can be controlled by the phase difference across the junction.

It is shown that there is a link between the formulation of the topological invariant presented here and the number of robust edge states. A formula is also provided which greatly simplifies the computation of the invariant in a large number of cases.

Each pair of bands related by time reversal is described by one Z2 invariant, up to one less than half the dimension of the Bloch Hamiltonians. In three dimensions, there are four such invariants per band pair. The Z2 invariants of a crystal determine the transitions between ordinary and topological insulators as its bands are occupied by electrons. We derive these invariants using maps from the Brillouin zone to the space of Bloch Hamiltonians and clarify the connections between Z2 invariants, the integer invariants that underlie the integer quantum Hall effect, and previous invariants of T-invariant Fermi systems.},

 abstract = {Heterostructures utilizing topological insulators exhibit a remarkable spin-torque efficiency. However, the exact origin of the strong torque, in particular whether it stems from the spin-momentum locking of the topological surface states or rather from spin-Hall physics of the topological-insulator bulk remains unclear. Here, we explore a mechanism of spin-torque generation purely based on the topological surface states. We consider topological-insulator-based bilayers involving ferromagnetic metal (TI/FM) and magnetically doped topological insulators (TI/mdTI), respectively. By ascribing the key theoretical differences between the two setups to location and number of active surface states, we describe both setups within the same framework of spin diffusion of the non-equilibrium spin density of the topological surface states. For the TI/FM bilayer, we find large spin-torque efficiencies of roughly equal magnitude for both in-plane and out-of-plane spin torques. For the TI/mdTI bilayer, we elucidate the dominance of the spin-transfer-like torque. However, we cannot explain the orders of magnitude enhancement reported. Nevertheless, our model gives an intuitive picture of spin-torque generation in topological-insulator-based bilayers and provides theoretical constraints on spin-torque generation due to topological surface states.},

 abstract = {Spin-transfer torques occur in magnetic heterostructures because the transverse component of a spin current that flows from a nonmagnet into a ferromagnet is absorbed at the interface. We demonstrate this fact explicitly using free-electron models and first-principles electronic structure calculations for real material interfaces. Three distinct processes contribute to the absorption: (1) spin-dependent reflection and transmission, (2) rotation of reflected and transmitted spins, and (3) spatial precession of spins in the ferromagnet. When summed over all Fermi surface electrons, these processes reduce the transverse component of the transmitted and reflected spin currents to nearly zero for most systems of interest. Therefore, to a good approximation, the torque on the magnetization is proportional to the transverse piece of the incoming spin current.},

We find that the nonequilibrium magnetization dynamics is governed by a stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation with spin transfer torques. We calculate the Gilbert damping parameter \$\alpha\$ and the non-adiabatic spin transfer torque parameter \$\beta\$ for a model ferromagnet. We find that \$\beta \neq \alpha\$, in agreement with the results obtained using imaginary-time methods of Kohno, Tatara and Shibata [J. Phys. Soc. Japan 75, 113706 (2006)]. We comment on the relationship between \$$s$--$d$\$ and isotropic-Stoner toy models of ferromagnetism and more realistic density-functional-theory models, and on the implications of these relationships for predictions of the \$\beta/\alpha\$ ratio which plays a central role in domain wall motion. Only for a single-parabolic-band isotropic-Stoner model with an exchange splitting that is small compared to the Fermi energy does \$\beta/\alpha\$ approach one. In addition, our microscopic formalism incorporates naturally the fluctuations needed in a nonzero-temperature description of the magnetization. We find that to first order in the applied electric field, the usual form of thermal fluctuations via a phenomenological stochastic magnetic field holds.},

 abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1$-$xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

It is now shown that even without this spin-polarized injection, a current can induce strong spin torques through the Rashba effect.

 title = {Semiclassical theory of spin-orbit torques in disordered multiband electron systems},
 abstract = {We study spin-orbit torques (SOT) in non-degenerate multiband electron systems in the weak disorder limit. Using the two-dimensional Rashba ferromagnet as a model system, we show that the antidamping-like SOT arising from disorder-induced interband-coherence effects is very sensitive to the spin structure of disorder and may have the same sign as the intrinsic SOT in the presence of spin-dependent disorder. While the cancellation of this SOT and the intrinsic one occurs only in the case of spin-independent short-range disorder. In order to have better physical transparency a semiclassical Boltzmann approach equivalent to the Kubo diagrammatic approach in the non- crossing approximation is formulated. This semiclassical framework accounts for the interband- coherence effects induced by both the electric field and static impurity scattering.},

 abstract = {We develop a phenomenological hydrodynamic theory of coherent magnetic precession coupled to electric currents. Exchange interaction between electron spin and collective magnetic texture produces two reciprocal effects: spin-transfer torque on the magnetic order parameter and the Berry-phase gauge field experienced by the itinerant electrons. The dissipative processes are governed by three coefficients: the ohmic resistance, Gilbert damping of the magnetization, and the ``$\beta$ coefficient'' describing viscous coupling between magnetic dynamics and electric current, which stems from spin mistracking of the magnetic order. We develop general magnetohydrodynamic equations and discuss the net dissipation produced by the coupled dynamics. The latter in particular allows us to determine a lower bound on the magnetic-texture resistivity.},

 abstract = {Quantum optoelectronic devices capable of isolating a target degree of freedom (DoF) from other DoFs have allowed for new applications in modern information technology. Many works on solid-state spintronics have focused on methods to disentangle the spin DoF from the charge DoF1, yet many related issues remain unresolved. Although the recent advent of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has enabled the use of valley pseudospin as an alternative DoF2,3, it is nontrivial to separate the spin DoF from the valley DoF since the time-reversal valley DoF is intrinsically locked with the spin DoF4. Here, we demonstrate lateral TMD--graphene--topological insulator hetero-devices with the possibility of such a DoF-selective measurement. We generate the valley-locked spin DoF via a circular photogalvanic effect in an electric-double-layer WSe2 transistor. The valley-locked spin photocarriers then diffuse in a submicrometre-long graphene layer, and the spin DoF is measured separately in the topological insulator via non-local electrical detection using the characteristic spin--momentum locking. Operating at room temperature, our integrated devices exhibit a non-local spin polarization degree of higher than 0.5, providing the potential for coupled opto-spin--valleytronic applications that independently exploit the valley and spin DoFs.},

 abstract = {The interaction of subpicosecond laser pulses with magnetically ordered materials has developed into a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. From the discovery of subpicosecond demagnetization over a decade ago to the recent demonstration of magnetization reversal by a single 40fs laser pulse, the manipulation of magnetic order by ultrashort laser pulses has become a fundamentally challenging topic with a potentially high impact for future spintronics, data storage and manipulation, and quantum computation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms implies understanding the interaction of photons with charges, spins, and lattice, and the angular momentum transfer between them. This paper will review the progress in this field of laser manipulation of magnetic order in a systematic way. Starting with a historical introduction, the interaction of light with magnetically ordered matter is discussed. By investigating metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics, the roles of (nearly) free electrons, charge redistributions, and spin-orbit and spin-lattice interactions can partly be separated, and effects due to heating can be distinguished from those that are not. It will be shown that there is a fundamental distinction between processes that involve the actual absorption of photons and those that do not. It turns out that for the latter, the polarization of light plays an essential role in the manipulation of the magnetic moments at the femtosecond time scale. Thus, circularly and linearly polarized pulses are shown to act as strong transient magnetic field pulses originating from the nonabsorptive inverse Faraday and inverse Cotton-Mouton effects, respectively. The recent progress in the understanding of magneto-optical effects on the femtosecond time scale together with the mentioned inverse, optomagnetic effects promises a bright future for this field of ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic order or femtomagnetism.},

Our studies indicate that the ferrimagnetism in the GdFeCo alloy is considerably influenced by both thicknesses due to the diffusion of Gd atoms toward the MgO layer. Comparing to conventional Pt/ferromagnet/MgO structures, the Pt/GdFeCo/MgO exhibits a lower efficiency of SOTs associated with ferrimagnetic order and a similar magnitude of magnetic damping. The previous models that have been developed for rigid ferromagnets are inappropriate to analyze our experimental data, leading to an unphysical consequence of spin transmission larger than unity. Our results imply that the heavy-metal/ferrimagnet system is quite different from heavy-metal/ferromagnet systems in terms of magnetic dynamical modes, spin angular momentum transfer, and relaxation processes.},

 abstract = {Engineering the electronic band structure of material systems enables the unprecedented exploration of new physical properties that are absent in natural or as-synthetic materials. Half metallicity, an intriguing physical property arising from the metallic nature of electrons with singular spin polarization and insulating for oppositely polarized electrons, holds a great potential for a 100\% spin-polarized current for high-efficiency spintronics. Conventionally synthesized thin films hardly sustain half metallicity inherited from their 3D counterparts. A fundamental challenge, in systems of reduced dimensions, is the almost inevitable spin-mixed edge or surface states in proximity to the Fermi level. Here, we predict electric field-induced half metallicity in bilayer A-type antiferromagnetic van der Waals crystals (i.e., intralayer ferromagnetism and interlayer antiferromagnetism), by employing density functional theory calculations on vanadium diselenide. Electric fields lift energy levels of the constituent layers in opposite directions, leading to the gradual closure of the gap of singular spin-polarized states and the opening of the gap of the others. We show that a vertical electrical field is a generic and effective way to achieve half metallicity in A-type antiferromagnetic bilayers and realize the spin field effect transistor. The electric field-induced half metallicity represents an appealing route to realize 2D half metals and opens opportunities for nanoscale highly efficient antiferromagnetic spintronics for information processing and storage.},

 abstract = {We formulate a general microscopic approach to spin-orbit torques in thin ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayers in linear response to electric current or electric field. The microscopic theory we develop avoids the notion of spin currents and spin-Hall effect. Instead, the torques are directly related to a local spin polarization of conduction electrons, which is computed from generalized Kubo-St{\v r}eda formulas. A symmetry analysis provides a one-to-one correspondence between polarization susceptibility tensor components and different torque terms in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics. The spin-orbit torques arising from Rashba or Dresselhaus type of spin-orbit interaction are shown to have different symmetries. We analyze these spin-orbit torques microscopically for a generic electron model in the presence of an arbitrary smooth magnetic texture. For a model with spin-independent disorder we find a major cancellation of the torques. In this case the only remaining torque corresponds to the magnetization-independent Edelstein effect. Furthermore, our results are applied to analyze the dynamics of a skyrmion under the action of electric current.},

The band structure is modified by photon dressing with a new dispersion, where the topological property is altered. By increasing the intensity of light at Ez=0, a photoinduced quantum Hall insulator is realized. Its edge modes are anisotropic chiral, in which the velocities of up and down spins are different. At Ez{\textgreater }Ecr with a certain critical field Ecr, a photoinduced spin-polarized quantum Hall insulator emerges. This is a new state of matter, possessing one Chern number and one-half spin-Chern numbers. We newly discover a single Dirac-cone state along a phase boundary.

 abstract = {We present a microscopic theory to give a physical picture of the formation of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in magnetized graphene coupled with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Based on a continuum model at valley K or K', we show that there exist two distinct physical origins of the QAH effect at two different limits. For large exchange field M, the quantization of Hall conductance in the absence of Landau-level quantization can be regarded as a summation of the topological charges carried by skyrmions from real-spin textures and merons from AB sublattice pseudospin textures, while for strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$R, the four-band low-energy model Hamiltonian is reduced to a two-band extended Haldane model, giving rise to a nonzero Chern number C=1 at either K or K'. In the presence of staggered AB sublattice potential U, a topological phase transition occurs at U=M from a QAH phase to a quantum valley Hall phase. We further find that the band gap responses at K and K' are different when $\lambda$R, M, and U are simultaneously considered. We also show that the QAH phase is robust against weak intrinsic spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$SO, and it transitions to a trivial phase when $\lambda$SO{\textgreater }(M2+$\lambda$R2+M)/2. Moreover, we use a tight-binding model to reproduce the ab initio method obtained band structures through doping magnetic atoms on 3{\texttimes }3 and 4{\texttimes }4 supercells of graphene, and explain the physical mechanisms of opening a nontrivial bulk gap to realize the QAH effect in different supercells of graphene.},

This effect results in a substantial enhancement of the nonadiabatic torque and, hence, improves the Skyrmion mobility. This nonadiabatic torque increases when decreasing the Skyrmion size, and, therefore, scaling down results in a much higher torque efficiency. In clean AFM Sks, we find a significant boost of the TSHE close to the van Hove singularity. Interestingly, this effect is enhanced away from the band gap in the presence of nonmagnetic interstitial defects. Furthermore, unlike their ferromagnetic counterpart, the TSHE in AFM Sks increases with an increase in the disorder strength, thus opening promising avenues for materials engineering of this effect.},

We show that spin-orbit torques drive antiferromagnetic domain walls much faster than ferromagnetic domain walls. As the domain wall velocity approaches the maximum spin-wave group velocity, the domain wall undergoes Lorentz contraction and emits spin waves in the terahertz frequency range. The interplay between spin-orbit torques and the relativistic dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls leads to the efficient manipulation of antiferromagnetic spin textures and paves the way for the generation of high frequency signals from antiferromagnets.},

Here, we propose the counterpart of the magnetic skyrmion in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) system, that is, the AFM skyrmion, which is topologically protected but without showing the SkHE. Two approaches for creating the AFM skyrmion have been described based on micromagnetic lattice simulations: (i) by injecting a vertical spin-polarized current to a nanodisk with the AFM ground state; (ii) by converting an AFM domain-wall pair in a nanowire junction. It is demonstrated that the AFM skyrmion, driven by the spin-polarized current, can move straightly over long distance, benefiting from the absence of the SkHE. Our results will open a new strategy on designing the novel spintronic devices based on AFM materials.},

We show that Skyrmions can also be stabilized and manipulated in antiferromagnetic materials. An antiferromagnetic Skyrmion is a compound topological object with a similar but of opposite sign spin texture on each sublattice, which, e.g., results in a complete cancellation of the Magnus force.

The existing approaches to THz-frequency generation based on superconductor Josephson junctions (JJ), free electron lasers, and quantum cascades require cryogenic temperatures or/and complex setups, preventing the miniaturization and wide use of these devices. We demonstrate theoretically that a bi-layer of a heavy metal (Pt) and a bi-axial antiferromagnetic (AFM) dielectric (NiO) can be a source of a coherent THz signal. A spin-current flowing from a DC-current-driven Pt layer and polarized along the hard AFM anisotropy axis excites a non-uniform in time precession of magnetizations sublattices in the AFM, due to the presence of a weak easy-plane AFM anisotropy. The frequency of the AFM oscillations varies in the range of 0.1{--}2.0 THz with the driving current in the Pt layer from 108 A/cm2 to 109 A/cm2. The THz-frequency signal from the AFM with the amplitude exceeding 1 V/cm is picked up by the inverse spin-Hall effect in Pt. The operation of a room-temperature AFM THz-frequency oscillator is similar to that of a cryogenic JJ oscillator, with the energy of the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy playing the role of the Josephson energy.},

Even in insulating antiferromagnets, the localized spins can strongly couple to itinerant spins in adjacent metals via spin-transfer torque and spin pumping. We describe the formation of steady-state magnon condensates controlled by a spin accumulation polarized along the staggered field in an adjacent normal metal. Two types of magnons, which carry opposite magnetic moments, exist in antiferromagnets. Consequently, and in contrast to ferromagnets, Bose-Einstein condensation can occur for either sign of the spin accumulation. This condensation may occur even at room temperature when the interaction with the normal metal is fast compared to the relaxation processes within the antiferromagnet. In antiferromagnets, the operating frequencies of the condensate are orders of magnitude higher than in ferromagnets.},

 abstract = {One of the main obstacles that prevents practical applications of antiferromagnets is the difficulty of manipulating the magnetic order parameter. Recently, following the theoretical prediction [J. {\v Z}elezn{\'y} others, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 157201 (2014)], the electrical switching of magnetic moments in an antiferromagnet was demonstrated [P. Wadley others, Science 351, 587 (2016)]. The switching is due to the so-called spin-orbit torque, which has been extensively studied in ferromagnets. In this phenomena a nonequilibrium spin-polarization exchange coupled to the ordered local moments is induced by current, hence exerting a torque on the order parameter. Here we give a general systematic analysis of the symmetry of the spin-orbit torque in locally and globally noncentrosymmetric crystals. We study when the symmetry allows for a nonzero torque, when is the torque effective, and its dependence on the applied current direction and orientation of magnetic moments. For comparison, we consider both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders. In two representative model crystals we perform microscopic calculations of the spin-orbit torque to illustrate its symmetry properties and to highlight conditions under which the spin-orbit torque can be efficient for manipulating antiferromagnetic moments.},

A large enhancement of the torque, characterized by an effective spin-Hall angle exceeding most heavy transition metals, correlates with the presence of the exchange-bias field at the NiFe/IrMn interface.

 abstract = {We observe the excitation of collective modes in the terahertz (THz) range driven by the recently discovered N{\'e}el spin-orbit torques (NSOTs) in the metallic antiferromagnet Mn2Au. Temperature-dependent THz spectroscopy reveals a strong absorption mode centered near 1 THz, which upon heating from 4 to 450 K softens and loses intensity. A comparison with the estimated eigenmode frequencies implies that the observed mode is an in-plane antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR). The AFMR absorption strength exceeds those found in antiferromagnetic insulators, driven by the magnetic field of the THz radiation, by 3 orders of magnitude. Based on this and the agreement with our theory modeling, we infer that the driving mechanism for the observed mode is the current-induced NSOT. Here the electric field component of the THz pulse drives an ac current in the metal, which subsequently drives the AFMR. This electric manipulation of the N{\'e}el order parameter at high frequencies makes Mn2Au a prime candidate for antiferromagnetic ultrafast memory applications.},

Compared to other SOT materials, metallic antiferromagnet (AFM) potentially allows the control of SOT through its magnetic structure. Here, combining the results from neutron diffraction and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance experiments, we show that the magnetic structure of epitaxially grown L10-IrMn (a collinear AFM) is distinct from the widely presumed bulk one. It consists of twin domains, with the spin axes orienting toward [111] and [-111], respectively. This unconventional magnetic structure is responsible for much larger SOT efficiencies up to 0.60 {$\pm$} 0.04, compared to 0.083 {$\pm$} 0.002 for the polycrystalline IrMn. Furthermore, we reveal that this magnetic structure induces a large isotropic bulk contribution and a comparable anisotropic interfacial contribution to the SOT efficiency. Our findings shed light on the critical roles of bulk and interfacial antiferromagnetism to SOT generated by metallic AFM. Collinear IrMn offers new opportunities for future magnetic memory design as it can be an effective source of spin-orbit torque.

 abstract = {Efficient electrical switching of antiferromagnets is at the center of their application in high-density and ultrafast nonvolatile memories. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mn2Au with opposite-spin sublattices is a unique metallic material in which the Edelstein effect can induce fieldlike torque switching of the AFM moments. However, the antidamping-torque-induced AFM moment switching remains to be proved in metallic AFM materials. Here, we demonstrate current-induced AFM moment switching in both a (103)-oriented Mn2Au single layer and Mn2Au/Pt heterojunction, detected by the spin Hall magnetoresistance and anisotropic magnetoresistance at room temperature. In (103)-oriented Mn2Au, fieldlike torque induces the alignment of AFM moments perpendicular to the writing current direction. Once the (103)-oriented Mn2Au film is covered by a thin Pt layer, the antidamping torque induced by the spin current from the Pt layer drives the AFM moments of Mn2Au switching toward the direction parallel to the writing current, which is in contrast to the case without Pt. The simultaneous realization of fieldlike torque and antidamping torque in metallic Mn2Au makes it a promising candidate in AFM spintronics.},

 abstract = {Spin-orbit coupling in inversion-asymmetric magnetic crystals and structures has emerged as a powerful tool to generate complex magnetic textures, interconvert charge and spin under applied current, and control magnetization dynamics. Current-induced spin-orbit torques mediate the transfer of angular momentum from the lattice to the spin system, leading to sustained magnetic oscillations or switching of ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic structures. The manipulation of magnetic order, domain walls and skyrmions by spin-orbit torques provides evidence of the microscopic interactions between charge and spin in a variety of materials and opens novel strategies to design spintronic devices with potentially high impact in data storage, nonvolatile logic, and magnonic applications. This paper reviews recent progress in the field of spin-orbitronics, focusing on theoretical models, material properties, and experimental results obtained on bulk noncentrosymmetric conductors and multilayer heterostructures, including metals, semiconductors, and topological insulator systems. Relevant aspects for improving the understanding and optimizing the efficiency of nonequilibrium spin-orbit phenomena in future nanoscale devices are also discussed.},

The body-centered tetragonal antiferromagnet Mn2Au with opposite-spin sublattices is a unique metallic material for N{\'e}el-order spin-orbit-torque (SOT) switching. We investigate the SOT switching in quasiepitaxial (103), (101) and (204) Mn2Au films prepared by a simple magnetron sputtering method. We demonstrate current-induced antiferromagnetic moment switching in all of the prepared Mn2Au films by using a short current pulse at room temperature, whereas differently oriented films exhibit distinguished switching characters. A direction-independent reversible switching is attained in Mn2Au (103) films due to negligible magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, while for Mn2Au (101) and (204) films, the switching is invertible with the current applied along the in-plane easy axis and its vertical axis, but it becomes attenuated seriously during initial switching circles when the current is applied along the hard axis because of the existence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. Besides the fundamental significance, the strong orientation-dependent SOT switching, which is not realized, irrespective of ferromagnet and antiferromagnet, provides versatility for spintronics.},

Interestingly, upon strong disorder the spin torque develops an antidamping component (i.e., even upon magnetization reversal) along the edges, which could enable current-driven manipulation of the antiferromagnetic order parameter. This antidamping torque decreases when increasing the system size and when the system enters the trivial insulator regime.},

We discuss general Green's function expressions suitable to compute the linear-response SOT in disordered ferromagnets. The SOT can be decomposed into an even and an odd component with respect to magnetization reversal, where in the limit of vanishing disorder the even SOT is given by the constant Berry curvature of the occupied states, while the odd part exhibits a divergence with respect to disorder strength. Within this formalism, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations of the SOT in Co/Pt(111) and Mn/W(001) magnetic bilayers. We find the even and odd torque components to be of comparable magnitude. Moreover, the odd torque depends strongly on an additional capping layer, while the even torque is less sensitive. We show that the even torque is nearly entirely mediated by spin currents in contrast to the odd torque, which can contain an important contribution not due to spin transfer. Our results are in agreement with experiments, showing that our linear-response theory is well-suited for the description of SOTs in complex ferromagnets.},

First, we present results on the voltage control of antiferromagnetic order in insulating thin films. The experiments show that voltage pulses can switch the chirality of a modulated antiferromagnetic structure. Second, we describe the recent advances in metallic antiferromagnetic systems.

We experimentally demonstrate at room temperature that the speed of reversible electrical writing in a memory device can be scaled up to terahertz using an antiferromagnet. A current-induced spin-torque mechanism is responsible for the switching in our memory devices throughout the 12-order-of-magnitude range of writing speeds from hertz to terahertz.

Such torques arise from current-induced local fields that alternate their orientation on each sublattice of the antiferromagnet and whose orientation depends primarily on the current direction, giving them their fieldlike character. The domain wall velocities that can be achieved by this mechanism are 2 orders of magnitude greater than the ones in ferromagnets. This arises from the efficiency of the staggered spin-orbit fields to couple to the order parameter and from the exchange-enhanced phenomena in antiferromagnetic texture dynamics, which leads to a low domain wall effective mass and the absence of a Walker breakdown limit. In addition, because of its nature, the staggered spin-orbit field can lift the degeneracy between two 180{$^\circ$} rotated states in a collinear antiferromagnet, and it provides a force that can move such walls and control the switching of the states.},

 abstract = {Antiferromagnets are promising for future spintronic applications owing to their advantageous properties: They are magnetically ordered, but neighboring magnetic moments point in opposite directions, which results in zero net magnetization. This means antiferromagnets produce no stray fields and are insensitive to external magnetic field perturbations. Furthermore, they show intrinsic high frequency dynamics, exhibit considerable spin{--}orbit and magneto-transport effects. Over the past decade, it has been realized that antiferromagnets have more to offer than just being utilized as passive components in exchange bias applications. This development resulted in a paradigm shift, which opens the pathway to novel concepts using antiferromagnets for spin-based technologies and applications. This article gives a broad perspective on antiferromagnetic spintronics. In particular, the manipulation and detection of antiferromagnetic states by spintronics effects, as well as spin transport and dynamics in antiferromagnetic materials will be discussed.

 abstract = {Antiferromagnetic materials could represent the future of spintronic applications thanks to the numerous interesting features they combine: they are robust against perturbation due to magnetic fields, produce no stray fields, display ultrafast dynamics, and are capable of generating large magnetotransport effects. Intense research efforts over the past decade have been invested in unraveling spin transport properties in antiferromagnetic materials. Whether spin transport can be used to drive the antiferromagnetic order and how subsequent variations can be detected are some of the thrilling challenges currently being addressed. Antiferromagnetic spintronics started out with studies on spin transfer and has undergone a definite revival in the last few years with the publication of pioneering articles on the use of spin-orbit interactions in antiferromagnets. This paradigm shift offers possibilities for radically new concepts for spin manipulation in electronics. Central to these endeavors are the need for predictive models, relevant disruptive materials, and new experimental designs. This paper reviews the most prominent spintronic effects described based on theoretical and experimental analysis of antiferromagnetic materials. It also details some of the remaining bottlenecks and suggests possible avenues for future research. This review covers both spin-transfer-related effects, such as spin-transfer torque, spin penetration length, domain-wall motion, and {\textquotedblleft }magnetization{\textquotedblright } dynamics, and spin-orbit related phenomena, such as (tunnel) anisotropic magnetoresistance, spin Hall, and inverse spin galvanic effects. Effects related to spin caloritronics, such as the spin Seebeck effect, are linked to the transport of magnons in antiferromagnets. The propagation of spin waves and spin superfluids in antiferromagnets is also covered.},

 abstract = {Manipulating a stubborn magnet Spintronics is an alternative to conventional electronics, based on using the electron's spin rather than its charge. Spintronic devices, such as magnetic memory, have traditionally used ferromagnetic materials to encode the 1's and 0's of the binary code. A weakness of this approach{---}that strong magnetic fields can erase the encoded information{---}could be avoided by using antiferromagnets instead of ferromagnets. But manipulating the magnetic ordering of antiferromagnets is tricky. Now, Wadley others have found a way (see the Perspective by Marrows). Running currents along specific directions in the thin films of the antiferromagnetic compound CuMnAs reoriented the magnetic domains in the material. Science, this issue p. 587; see also p. 558 Antiferromagnets are hard to control by external magnetic fields because of the alternating directions of magnetic moments on individual atoms and the resulting zero net magnetization. However, relativistic quantum mechanics allows for generating current-induced internal fields whose sign alternates with the periodicity of the antiferromagnetic lattice. Using these fields, which couple strongly to the antiferromagnetic order, we demonstrate room-temperature electrical switching between stable configurations in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin-film devices by applied current with magnitudes of order 106 ampere per square centimeter. Electrical writing is combined in our solid-state memory with electrical readout and the stored magnetic state is insensitive to and produces no external magnetic field perturbations, which illustrates the unique merits of antiferromagnets for spintronics. Transport and optical measurements are used to demonstrate the switching of domains in the antiferromagnetic compound CuMnAs. [Also see Perspective by Marrows] Transport and optical measurements are used to demonstrate the switching of domains in the antiferromagnetic compound CuMnAs. [Also see Perspective by Marrows]},

We review the experimental literature that provides partial evidence for these AFM spintronic effects but demonstrates that, like exchange-bias effects, they are sensitive to details of interface structure that are not always under experimental control. Finally, we speculate briefly on some strategies that might advance progress.},

 abstract = {This article reviews spintronics based memories, in particular, magnetic random access memory (MRAM) in a systematic manner. Debuted as a humble 4Mb product by FreeScale in 2006, the MRAM has grown to a 256Mb product of Everspin in 2016. During this period, MRAM has overcome several hurdles and have reached a stage, where the potential for MRAM is very promising. One of the main hurdles that the MRAM overcome between 2006 and 2016 is the way the information is written. The 4Mb MRAM used a magnetic field based switching technology that would be almost impossible to scale below 100nm. The 256Mb MRAM, on the other hand uses a different writing mechanism based on Spin Transfer Torque (STT), which is scalable to very low dimensions. In addition to the difference in the writing mechanism, there has also been a major shift in the storage material. Whereas the 4Mb MRAM used materials with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the 256Mb MRAM uses materials with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). MRAM based on PMA is also scalable to much higher densities. The paper starts with a brief history of memory technologies, followed by a brief description of the working principles of MRAM for novice. Reading information from MRAM, the technologies, materials and the physics behind reading of bits in MRAM are described in detail. As a next step, the physics and technologies involved in writing information are described. The magnetic field based writing and its limitations are described first, followed by an explanation of STT mechanism. The materials and physics behind storage of information is described next. MRAMs with in-plane magnetization, their layered material structure and the disadvantages are described first, followed by the advantages of MRAMs with perpendicular magnetization, their advantages etc. The technologies to improve writability and potential challenges and reliability issues are discussed next. Some of the future technologies that might help the industry to move beyond the conventional MRAM technology are discussed at the end of the paper, followed by a summary and an outlook.},

In experiments, synthesized Bi2Se3 is often heavily n-type doped due to selenium vacancies. Furthermore, it is discovered from experiments on bulk single crystals that Bi2Se3 gets additional n-type doping after exposure to the atmosphere, thereby reducing the relative contribution of SS in total conductivity. In this article, transport measurements on Bi2Se3 nanoribbons provide additional evidence of such environmental doping process. Systematic surface composition analyses by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal fast formation and continuous growth of native oxide on Bi2Se3 under ambient conditions. In addition to n-type doping at the surface, such surface oxidation is likely the material origin of the degradation of topological SS. Appropriate surface passivation or encapsulation may be required to probe topological SS of Bi2Se3 by transport measurements.},

 abstract = {Strong spin-momentum coupling in topological insulators give rise to topological surface states, protected against disorder scattering by time reversal symmetry. The study of these exotic quantum states not only provides an opportunity to explore fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics such as the spin hall effect, but also lays the foundation for applications in quantum computing to spintronics. Conventional electrical measurements suffer from substantial bulk interference, making it difficult to clearly identify topological surface state from the bulk. We use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to study the temperature-dependent optical behavior of a 23quintuple-thick film of bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) allowing the deconvolution of the surface state response from the bulk. The signatures of the topological surface state at low temperatures ({\textless } 30 K) with the optical conductance of Bi2Se3 exhibiting a metallic behavior are observed. Measurement of carrier dynamics, obtain an optical mobility, exceeding 2000 cm2/Vs at 4 K, indicative of a surfacedominated response. A scattering lifetime of {\textasciitilde }0.18 ps and a carrier density of 6$\times$1012 cm-2 at 4 K were obtained from the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy measurement. The terahertz conductance spectra reveal characteristic features at {\textasciitilde }1.9 THz, attributed to the optical phonon mode, which becomes less prominent with falling temperature. The electrical transport measurements reveal weak antilocalization behavior in our Bi2Se3 sample, consistent with the presence of a topological surface state.},

 abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) are new forms of quantum matter that are characterized by their insulating bulk state and exotic metallic surface state, which hosts helical Dirac fermions1-2. Very recently, BiTeCl, one of the polar semiconductors, has been discovered by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to be the first strong inversion asymmetric topological insulator (SIATI). In contrast to the previously discovered 3D TIs with inversion symmetry, the SIATI are expected to exhibit novel topological phenomena, including crystalline-surface-dependent topological surface states, intrinsic topological p-n junctions, and pyroelectric and topological magneto-electric effects3. Here, we report the first transport evidence for the robust topological surface state in the SIATI BiTeCl via observation of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, which exhibit the 2D nature of the Fermi surface and pi Berry phase. The n = 1 Landau quantization of the topological surface state is observed at B . 12 T without gating, and the Fermi level is only 58.8 meV above the Dirac point, which gives rise to small effective mass, 0.055me, and quite large mobility, 4490 cm2s-1. Our findings will pave the way for future transport exploration of other new topological phenomena and potential applications for strong inversion asymmetric topological insulators.},

 abstract = {A major challenge in spintronics is to find an efficient means to manipulate antiferromagnet (AFM) states, which are inert relative to a uniform magnetic field, due to the vanishingly-small net magnetization. The question is, how does an AFM response to an inhomogeneous field? Here we address the problem through a complete classification of the magnetic forces on an AFM domain wall (DW), revealing the following physical properties: (i) the tiny net magnetization still responses to the field gradient. (ii) the N\'{\{}e{\}}el order is sensitive to the field difference between two sublattices. (iii) DW energy has a quadratic dependence on the magnetic field due to its noncollinear structure. Remarkably, the first two factors drive DW to the opposite directions in a nanowire, but the third effect tends to push the DW to the high field region. Consequently, the competition among these three forces can be applied to understand the seemingly-contradictory results on AFM motion in literature. Additionally, our results provide a new route for a speedy manipulating AFM DW; our numerical simulation indicated that for a synthetic antiferromagnet, the DW propagating speed can reach tens of kilometers per second, an order of magnitude higher than that driven by an electric current.},

 abstract = {We theoretically investigate the dynamics of atomic domain walls (DWs) in antiferromagnets driven by a spin-orbit field. For a DW with the width of a few lattice constants, we identify a Peierls-like pinning effect, with the depinning field exponentially decaying with the DW width, so that a spin-orbit field moderately larger than the threshold can drive the propagation of an atomic DW in a step-wise manner. For a broad DW, the Peierls pinning is negligibly small. However, the external spin-orbit field can induce a fast DW propagation, accompanied by a significant shrinking of its width down to atomic scales. Before stepping into the pinning region, noticeable spin waves are emitted at the tail of the DW. The spin-wave emission event not only broadens the effective width of the DW, but also pushes the DW velocity over the magnonic barrier, which is generally believed to be the relativistic limit of the DW speed. While the existing dynamic theory based on the continuum approximation fails in the atomic scale, we develop an energy conversion theory to interpret the DW dynamics beyond the relativistic limit.},

 abstract = {It is generally accepted that the fastest way to reorient magnetization is through precessional motion in an external magnetic field1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. In ferromagnets, the application of a magnetic field instantaneously sets spins in motion and, in contrast to the inertial motion of massive bodies, the magnetization can climb over a potential barrier only during the action of a magnetic-field pulse. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different scenario of spin switching in antiferromagnets, where the exchange interaction between the spins leads to an inertial behaviour. Although the spin orientation hardly changes during the action of an optically generated strong magnetic-field pulse of 100 fs duration, this pulse transfers sufficient momentum to the spin system to overcome the potential barrier and reorient into a new metastable state, long after the action of the stimulus. Such an inertia-based mechanism of spin switching should offer new opportunities for ultrafast recording and processing of magnetically stored information.},

 abstract = {{\copyright } 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. Heat-driven magnetization damping, which is a linear function of a temperature gradient, is predicted in antiferromagnets by considering the sublattice dynamics subjected to a heat-driven spin torque. This points to the possibility of achieving spi n torque oscillator behavior. The model is based on the magnetic Seebeck effect acting on sublattices which are exchange coupled. The heat-driven spin torque is estimated and the feasibility of detecting this effect is discussed.},

 abstract = {We show how a charge current through a single antiferromagnetic layer can excite and control self-oscillations. Sustained oscillations with tunable amplitudes and frequencies are possible in a variety of geometries using certain classes of non-centrosymmetric materials that exhibit finite dissipative spin-orbit torque. We compute the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the current and spin-orbit torque magnitude. The anisotropic magnetoresistance causes the conversion of the resulting AF oscillations to a terahertz AC output voltage. These findings provide an attractive and novel route to design terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbit torque oscillators in simple single-layer structures.},

 abstract = {A combination of novel technological and fundamental physics prospects has sparked a huge interest in pure spin transport in magnets, starting with ferromagnets and spreading to antiferro- and ferrimagnets. We present a theoretical study of spin transport across a ferrimagnet{\$}|{\$}non-magnetic conductor interface, when a magnetic eigenmode is driven into a coherent state. The obtained spin current expression includes intra- as well as cross-sublattice terms, both of which are essential for a quantitative understanding of spin-pumping. The dc current is found to be sensitive to the asymmetry in interfacial coupling between the two sublattice magnetizations and the mobile electrons, especially for antiferromagnets. We further find that the concomitant shot noise provides a useful tool for probing the quasiparticle spin and interfacial coupling.},
