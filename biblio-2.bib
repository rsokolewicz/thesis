	abstract = {We demonstrate the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in single-layer graphene exchange coupled to an atomically flat yttrium iron garnet (YIG) ferromagnetic thin film. The anomalous Hall conductance has magnitude of ∼0.09(2e2/h) at low temperatures and is measurable up to ∼300 K. Our observations indicate not only proximity-induced ferromagnetism in graphene/YIG with a large exchange interaction, but also enhanced spin-orbit coupling that is believed to be inherently weak in ideal graphene. The proximity-induced ferromagnetic order in graphene can lead to novel transport phenomena such as the quantized AHE which are potentially useful for spintronics.},

We study the spin transport in exfoliated graphene on an yttrium–iron–garnet substrate where the observed spin precession clearly indicates the presence and strength of an exchange field that is an unambiguous evidence of induced ferromagnetism. We describe the results with a modified Bloch diffusion equation and extract an average exchange field of the order of 0.2 T. Further, we demonstrate that a proximity induced 2D ferromagnet can efficiently modulate a spin current by controlling the direction of the exchange field. These findings can create a building block for magnetic-gate tuneable spin transport in one-atom-thick spintronic devices.},

By artificially generating isolated vacancies on a graphite surface and measuring their local density of states on the atomic scale, we have shown how single vacancies modify the electronic properties of this graphenelike system. Our scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, complemented by tight-binding calculations, reveal the presence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around each single graphite vacancy, which can be associated with the formation of local magnetic moments and implies a dramatic reduction of the charge carriers’ mobility. While vacancies in single layer graphene lead to magnetic couplings of arbitrary sign, our results show the possibility of inducing a macroscopic ferrimagnetic state in multilayered graphene just by randomly removing single C atoms.},

Multilayer structures showing efficient spin injection and spin-related magnetotransport properties as well as enabling magnetization manipulation by strain, light, electric fields, and spin currents are presented together with their impact on metal spintronics. The challenging interplay between magnetic and electronic properties in topologically trivial and nontrivial systems is described, emphasizing the entangled roles of disorder and correlation at the carrier localization boundary. Finally, the case of dilute magnetic insulators is considered, such as (Ga,Mn)N, where low-temperature spin ordering is driven by short-ranged superexchange that is ferromagnetic for certain charge states of magnetic impurities.},

	abstract = {Spin-based technologies, in the form of magnetic compasses, have existed for thousands of years. However, it is only in the last century that the concept of spin, as a pure quantum phenomenon, was established, paving the way for new applications exploiting its quantum mechanical properties. This chapter introduces the underlying mechanisms behind spin ordering in magnetic materials, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) limit, and reviews historical milestones in the development of “spintronics” and electronic devices utilizing spin. Initially studied for fundamental physical interest, spintronic applications quickly came to prominence following the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and the rediscovery of tunneling magnetoresistance in metallic architectures. The desire to integrate these phenomena with the existing semiconductor-based technologies used in the computing industry has inspired intensive study of spintronics within semiconductor materials. Notable developments include the spin field-effect transistor and nonlocal device geometries. Following the discovery of novel electronic properties of graphene, there has been a drive to harness similar properties–with the addition of spin-control–in van der Waals or 2D materials, resulting in several families of 2D magnetic materials known today.},

With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly.

The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries.

It is proposed that the strain-dependent magnetic moment is related to the strong ionic–covalent bonds, while both the ferromagnetism and the variation in strength of magnetic coupling with strain arise from the combined effects of both through-bond and through-space interactions.

	abstract = {Quantum systems in confined geometries are host to novel physical phenomena. Examples include quantum Hall systems in semiconductors and Dirac electrons in graphene. Interest in such systems has also been intensified by the recent discovery of a large enhancement in photoluminescence quantum efficiency and a potential route to valleytronics in atomically thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te), which are closely related to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition in monolayers. Here, we report the first direct observation of the transition from indirect to direct bandgap in monolayer samples by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on high-quality thin films of MoSe2 with variable thickness, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The band structure measured experimentally indicates a stronger tendency of monolayer MoSe2 towards a direct bandgap, as well as a larger gap size, than theoretically predicted. Moreover, our finding of a significant spin-splitting of ∼180 meV at the valence band maximum of a monolayer MoSe2 film could expand its possible application to spintronic devices.},

	abstract = {Magnetic materials enjoy an envious position in the area of data storage, electronics, and even in biomedical field. This review provides an overview of low-dimensional magnetism in graphene, h-BN, and carbon nitrides, which originates from defects like vacancy, adatom, doping, and dangling bonds. In transition metal dichalcogenides, a tunable magnetism comes from doping, strain, and vacancy/defects, and these materials offer spintronics, as well as photoelectronic potentials, since they have an additional degree of freedom called valley state (e.g. MoS2). Strain- and layer-dependent magnetic ordering has been observed in layered compounds like CrXTe3, CrI3, and trisulfides. The magnetism in 2D oxides like MoO3, Ni(OH)2,and perovskites are also interesting as they are potential candidates for next-generation devices having faster processing and large data storage capacity. Quasi 2D magnetism in MXene and in atomically thin materials supported on 3D materials will also be discussed. Finally, some of the challenges related to the control of defects and imperfections in 2D lattice, promising approaches to overcome them will be covered.},
