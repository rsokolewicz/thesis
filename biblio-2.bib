	abstract = {Spin electronics is a rapidly expanding field stimulated by a strong synergy between breakthrough basic research discoveries and industrial applications in the fields of magnetic recording, magnetic field sensors, nonvolatile memories [magnetic random access memories (MRAM) and especially spin-transfer-torque MRAM (STT-MRAM)]. In addition to the discovery of several physical phenomena (giant magnetoresistance, tunnel magnetoresistance, spin-transfer torque, spin-orbit torque, spin Hall effect, spin Seebeck effect, etc.), outstanding progress has been made on the growth and nanopatterning of magnetic multilayered films and nanostructures in which these phenomena are observed. Magnetic anisotropy is usually observed in materials that have large spin-orbit interactions. However, in 2002 perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) was discovered to exist at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces [for instance Co(Fe)/alumina]. Surprisingly, this PMA is observed in systems where spin-orbit interactions are quite weak, but its amplitude is remarkably large—comparable to that measured at Co/Pt interfaces, a reference for large interfacial anisotropy (anisotropy∼1.4 erg/cm2=1.4 mJ/m2). Actually, this PMA was found to be very common at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces since it has been observed with a large variety of amorphous or crystalline oxides, including AlOx, MgO, TaOx, HfOx, etc. This PMA is thought to be the result of electronic hybridization between the oxygen and the magnetic transition metal orbit across the interface, a hypothesis supported by ab initio calculations. Interest in this phenomenon was sparked in 2010 when it was demonstrated that the PMA at magnetic transition metal/oxide interfaces could be used to build out-of-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions for STT-MRAM cells. In these systems, the PMA at the CoFeB/MgO interface can be used to simultaneously obtain good memory retention, thanks to the large PMA amplitude, and a low write current, thanks to a relatively weak Gilbert damping. These two requirements for memories tend to be difficult to reconcile since they rely on the same spin-orbit coupling. PMA-based approaches have now become ubiquitous in the designs for perpendicular STT-MRAM, and major microelectronics companies are actively working on their development with the first goal of addressing embedded FLASH and static random access memory-type of applications. Scalability of STT-MRAM devices based on this interfacial PMA is expected to soon exceed the 20-nm nodes. Several very active new fields of research also rely on interfacial PMA at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces, including spin-orbit torques associated with Rashba or spin Hall effects, record high speed domain wall propagation in buffer/magnetic metal/oxide-based magnetic wires, and voltage-based control of anisotropy. This review deals with PMA at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces from its discovery, by examining the diversity of systems in which it has been observed and the physicochemical methods through which the key roles played by the electronic hybridization at the metal/oxide interface were elucidated. The physical origins of the phenomenon are also covered and how these are supported by ab initio calculations is dealt with. Finally, some examples of applications of this interfacial PMA in STT-MRAM are listed along with the various emerging research topics taking advantage of this PMA.},

These equations capture a number of interrelated effects including spin accumulation and diffusion, Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation, magnetoelectric, and spin-galvanic effects. They can be used under very general circumstances to model transport experiments in 2DEG systems that involve either electrical or optical spin injection. We comment on the relationship between these equations and the exact spin and charge density operator equations of motion. As an example of the application of our equations, we consider a simple electrical spin injection experiment and show that a voltage will develop between two ferromagnetic contacts if a spin-polarized current is injected into a 2DEG, that depends on the relative magnetization orientation of the contacts. This voltage is present even when the separation between the contacts is larger than the spin diffusion length.},

	abstract = {This chapter is concerned with spin-resonance absorption—that is, power absorption from an oscillating magnetic field—by conduction electrons. The e place of spin resonance in investigations of the band structure contrasts the cases of paramagnetic salts and conductors. In the former, the levels of the ions are discrete; when they have an odd number of electrons each level is at least twofold degenerate. An external magnetic field splits this degeneracy. The microwave spectroscopy of the energy bands is not confined to spin resonance, but includes cyclotron resonance. Of the two, undoubtedly the latter provides the most direct information on the energy bands. Spin resonance does not play the central role that it does in paramagnetic salts. However, it usually plays a useful supplementary role when something about the band structure is known, serving either as a check on the band model or determining the values of additional parameters. The use of spin resonance in semiconductors and semimetals grow as better materials are made and detailed knowledge about their band structure becomes available.},

However, to use 2D vdW magnets for building spintronic nanodevices such as magnetic memories, key challenges remain in terms of effectively switching the magnetization from one state to the other electrically. Here, we devise a bilayer structure of Fe3GeTe2/Pt, in which the magnetization of few-layered Fe3GeTe2 can be effectively switched by the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the current flowing in the Pt layer. The effective magnetic fields corresponding to the SOTs are further quantitatively characterized using harmonic measurements. Our demonstration of the SOT-driven magnetization switching in a 2D vdW magnet could pave the way for implementing low-dimensional materials in the next-generation spintronic applications.

Their orders of magnitudes are estimated to be (Δgg) and (Δgg)2 times the isotropic superexchange energy, respectively. Higher order spin couplings are also discussed. As an example of antisymmetric spin coupling the case of CuCl2·2H2O is illustrated. In CuCl2·2H2O, a spin arrangement which is different from one accepted so far is proposed. This antisymmetric interaction is shown to be responsible for weak ferromagnetism in α-Fe2O3, MnCO3, and CrF3. The paramagnetic susceptibility perpendicular to the trigonal axis is expected to increase very sharply near the Néel temperature as the temperature is lowered, as was actually observed in CrF3.},

This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

	abstract = {Using electrical characteristics from three-terminal field-effect transistors (FETs), we demonstrate substantial strain induced band gap tunability in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in line with theoretical predictions and optical experiments. Devices were fabricated on flexible substrates, and a cantilever sample holder was used to apply uniaxial tensile strain to the various multilayer TMD FETs. Analyzing in particular transfer characteristics, we argue that the modified device characteristics under strain are clear evidence of a band gap reduction of 100 meV in WSe2 under 1.35\% uniaxial tensile strain at room temperature. Furthermore, the obtained device characteristics imply that the band gap does not shrink uniformly under strain relative to a reference potential defined by the source/drain contacts. Instead, the band gap change is only related to a change of the conduction band edge of WSe2, resulting in a decrease in the Schottky barrier (SB) for electrons without any change for hole injection into the valence band. Simulations of SB device characteristics are employed to explain this point and to quantify our findings. Last, our experimental results are compared with DFT calculations under strain showing excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and the experimental data presented here.},

	abstract = {The search for topologically non-trivial states of matter has become an important goal for condensed matter physics. Recently, a new class of topological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic field. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells (QWs). By varying the thickness of the QW, the band structure changes from a normal to an “inverted” type at a critical thickness  d c . We present an analytical solution of the helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te QWs. We review both the fabrication of the sample and the experimental setup. For thin QWs with well width  d QW {\textless}6.3 nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker QWs ( d QW {\textgreater}6.3 nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to 2 e 2 / h . The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness,  d c =6.3 nm, is also independently determined from the occurrence of a magnetic field induced insulator to metal transition.},

In modern spintronics, CSC is widely used to control the novel properties of materials and generate new functionalities of devices, due to the fact that the electrical operation is still the most efficient method to control various spintronic devices and compatible with modern technologies of electronics. The efficiency of CSC is in principle determined by the material property and the device structure; therefore tremendous efforts are put to explore new materials and new architectures. The 2D systems can serve as ideal material platforms to generate high-speed, high-density, and low-cost spintronic devices, due to their exotic spin properties.

Here, we give an extensive review of recent progress on synthetic methods and C–F bonding; additionally, we present the optical, electrical and electronic properties of fluorinated graphene and its electrochemical/biological applications. Fluorinated graphene exhibits various types of C–F bonds (covalent, semi-ionic, and ionic bonds), tunable F/C ratios, and different configurations controlled by synthetic methods including direct fluorination and exfoliation methods. The relationship between the types/amounts of C–F bonds and specific properties, such as opened bandgap, high thermal and chemical stability, dispersibility, semiconducting/insulating nature, magnetic, self-lubricating and mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, is discussed comprehensively. By optimizing the C–F bonding character and F/C ratios, fluorinated graphene can be utilized for energy conversion and storage devices, bioapplications, electrochemical sensors and amphiphobicity. Based on current progress, we propose potential problems of fluorinated graphene as well as the future challenge on the synthetic methods and C-F bonding character. This review will provide guidance for controlling C–F bonds, developing fluorine-related effects and promoting the application of fluorinated graphene.},

	abstract = {Two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D-hBN), an isomorph of graphene with a very similar layered structure, is uniquely featured by its exotic opto-electrical properties together with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. It is thus extensively studied for application in field effect transistors (FETs), tunneling devices, deep UV emitters and detectors, photoelectric devices, and nanofillers. 2D-hBN is considered as one of the most promising materials that can be integrated with other 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), for the next generation microelectronic and other technologies. Although it is by itself an insulator, it can well be tuned by several strategies in terms of properties and functionalities, such as by doping, substitution, functionalization and hybridization, making 2D-hBN a truly versatile type of functional materials for a wide range of applications. In this review, the distinct structural characteristics of 2D-hBN, doping- and defect-induced variations in energy bands and structures, and resultant properties, are presented. There are a wide variety of processing routes that have been developed for 2D-hBN, including also those for doping, substitution, functionalization and combination with other materials to form heterostructures or h-BNC hybrid nanosheets, which are systematically elaborated for novel functions. The comprehensive overview provides the types of the state-of-the-art 2D-hBN made by new synthesis strategies, where the mainstream approaches include exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and gas phase epitaxy, together with several other new methods that have been successfully developed in the past few years. On the basis of the extraordinary electrical and functional properties and thermal–mechanical stability, the applications of hBN-based nanosheets as substrates and dielectrics, passivation layers, and nanofillers in nanodevices and nanocomposites are discussed, together with the peculiar optical and wetting characteristics.},

Compared to 3D Dirac semimetals which fall into two distinct classes, Dirac semimetals in 2D with combined time-reversal and inversion symmetries belong to a single class which is closely related to the nonsymmorphic space-group symmetries. We further provide a concrete model in antiferromagnetic semimetals which supports symmetry-protected 2D Dirac points. The symmetry breaking in such systems leads to 2D chiral topological states such as quantum anomalous Hall insulator and chiral topological superconductor phases.},

The Dirac spectrum here was determined to arise mainly from the dx2−y2 and dz2 orbitals of Zr atoms. Additionally, the Dirac cones can be gapped when taking the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb repulsive interaction (U) into account, which opens an avenue for using the Zr2Si MXene for electronics applications.},

Optical transitions between Landau levels (LLs) were observed in the antiferromagnetic states of these two parent compounds. Our observation of a √B dependence of the LL transition energies, the zero-energy intercepts at B=0 T under the linear extrapolations of the transition energies and the energy ratio (∼2.4) between the observed LL transitions, combined with the linear band dispersions in two-dimensional (2D) momentum space obtained by theoretical calculations, demonstrates the existence of massless Dirac fermions in the antiferromagnet BaFe2As2. More importantly, the observed dominance of the zeroth-LL-related absorption features and the calculated bands with extremely weak dispersions along the momentum direction kz indicate that massless Dirac fermions in BaFe2As2 are 2D. Furthermore, we find that the total substitution of the barium atoms in BaFe2As2 by strontium atoms not only maintains 2D massless Dirac fermions in this system, but also enhances their Fermi velocity, which supports that the Dirac points in iron-arsenide parent compounds are topologically protected.},

	abstract = {Parity-time symmetry plays an essential role for the formation of Dirac states in Dirac semimetals. So far, all of the experimentally identified topologically nontrivial Dirac semimetals (DSMs) possess both parity and time reversal symmetry. The realization of magnetic topological DSMs remains a major issue in topological material research. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, it is ascertained that band inversion induces a topologically nontrivial ground state in EuCd2As2. As a result, ideal magnetic Dirac fermions with simplest double cone structure near the Fermi level emerge in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase. The magnetic order breaks time reversal symmetry, but preserves inversion symmetry. The double degeneracy of the Dirac bands is protected by a combination of inversion, time-reversal, and an additional translation operation. Moreover, the calculations show that a deviation of the magnetic moments from the c-axis leads to the breaking of C3 rotation symmetry, and thus, a small bandgap opens at the Dirac point in the bulk. In this case, the system hosts a novel state containing three different types of topological insulator: axion insulator, AFM topological crystalline insulator (TCI), and higher order topological insulator. The results provide an enlarged platform for the quest of topological Dirac fermions in a magnetic system.},

In striking contrast to earlier literature showing a full gap opening between two surface band manifolds on the (0001) surface, we observed a gapless Dirac surface state with a Dirac point sitting at EB=−280meV. Furthermore, our ARPES data revealed the existence of a second Dirac cone sitting closer to the Fermi level. Surprisingly, these surface states remain intact across the AFM transition. The presence of gapless Dirac states in this material may be caused by different ordering at the surface from the bulk or weaker magnetic coupling between the bulk and surface. Whereas the surface Dirac cones seem to be remarkably insensitive to the AFM ordering most likely due to weak coupling to magnetism, we did observe a splitting of the bulk band accompanying the AFM transition. With a moderately high ordering temperature and interesting gapless Dirac surface states, MnBi2Te4 provides a unique platform for studying the interplay between magnetic ordering and topology.},

We explicitly show edge states in zigzag and armchair nanoribbons and explore their localization behavior. Remarkably, the combination of staggered intrinsic spin-orbit and uniform exchange coupling gives topologically protected (unlike in time-reversal systems) pseudohelical states, whose spin is opposite in opposite zigzag edges. Rotating the magnetization from out of plane to in plane makes the system trivial, allowing us to control topological phase transitions.

Unlike SOT on conventional metallic ferromagnets brought into contact with normal materials supplying strong SOC, the predicted SOT on such doubly proximitized graphene can be tuned by up to two orders of magnitude via combined top and back electrostatic gates. The vdW heterostructure also reveals how damping-like component of the SOT vector can arise purely from interfaces and, therefore, even in the absence of any spin Hall current from the bulk of a material with strong SOC. The SOT-driven dynamics of proximity magnetization moves it from out-of-plane to in-plane direction which opens a gap in graphene and leads to zero off current and diverging on/off ratio in such SOT field-effect transistor.},

	abstract = {Atomic vacancies have a strong impact in the mechanical, electronic, and magnetic properties of graphenelike materials. By artificially generating isolated vacancies on a graphite surface and measuring their local density of states on the atomic scale, we have shown how single vacancies modify the electronic properties of this graphenelike system. Our scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, complemented by tight-binding calculations, reveal the presence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around each single graphite vacancy, which can be associated with the formation of local magnetic moments and implies a dramatic reduction of the charge carriers’ mobility. While vacancies in single layer graphene lead to magnetic couplings of arbitrary sign, our results show the possibility of inducing a macroscopic ferrimagnetic state in multilayered graphene just by randomly removing single C atoms.},

Multilayer structures showing efficient spin injection and spin-related magnetotransport properties as well as enabling magnetization manipulation by strain, light, electric fields, and spin currents are presented together with their impact on metal spintronics. The challenging interplay between magnetic and electronic properties in topologically trivial and nontrivial systems is described, emphasizing the entangled roles of disorder and correlation at the carrier localization boundary. Finally, the case of dilute magnetic insulators is considered, such as (Ga,Mn)N, where low-temperature spin ordering is driven by short-ranged superexchange that is ferromagnetic for certain charge states of magnetic impurities.},

	abstract = {Spin-based technologies, in the form of magnetic compasses, have existed for thousands of years. However, it is only in the last century that the concept of spin, as a pure quantum phenomenon, was established, paving the way for new applications exploiting its quantum mechanical properties. This chapter introduces the underlying mechanisms behind spin ordering in magnetic materials, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) limit, and reviews historical milestones in the development of “spintronics” and electronic devices utilizing spin. Initially studied for fundamental physical interest, spintronic applications quickly came to prominence following the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and the rediscovery of tunneling magnetoresistance in metallic architectures. The desire to integrate these phenomena with the existing semiconductor-based technologies used in the computing industry has inspired intensive study of spintronics within semiconductor materials. Notable developments include the spin field-effect transistor and nonlocal device geometries. Following the discovery of novel electronic properties of graphene, there has been a drive to harness similar properties–with the addition of spin-control–in van der Waals or 2D materials, resulting in several families of 2D magnetic materials known today.},

With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly.

The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries. The physics discussed here provides a route towards the integration of valleytronics and spintronics in multivalley materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking.},

It is proposed that the strain-dependent magnetic moment is related to the strong ionic–covalent bonds, while both the ferromagnetism and the variation in strength of magnetic coupling with strain arise from the combined effects of both through-bond and through-space interactions.

In particular, a number of critical challenges centered around the scalability, ambient stability and Curie temperature of these atomically thin magnets are discussed. This mini-review also provides an outlook on what the future might hold for this integrated field of 2D spintronics, and assesses its potential in postsilicon electronics.},

	abstract = {Magnetic materials enjoy an envious position in the area of data storage, electronics, and even in biomedical field. This review provides an overview of low-dimensional magnetism in graphene, h-BN, and carbon nitrides, which originates from defects like vacancy, adatom, doping, and dangling bonds. In transition metal dichalcogenides, a tunable magnetism comes from doping, strain, and vacancy/defects, and these materials offer spintronics, as well as photoelectronic potentials, since they have an additional degree of freedom called valley state (e.g. MoS2). Strain- and layer-dependent magnetic ordering has been observed in layered compounds like CrXTe3, CrI3, and trisulfides. The magnetism in 2D oxides like MoO3, Ni(OH)2,and perovskites are also interesting as they are potential candidates for next-generation devices having faster processing and large data storage capacity. Quasi 2D magnetism in MXene and in atomically thin materials supported on 3D materials will also be discussed. Finally, some of the challenges related to the control of defects and imperfections in 2D lattice, promising approaches to overcome them will be covered.},
