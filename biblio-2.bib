	abstract = {The search for topologically non-trivial states of matter has become an important goal for condensed matter physics. Recently, a new class of topological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic field. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells (QWs). By varying the thickness of the QW, the band structure changes from a normal to an “inverted” type at a critical thickness  d c . We present an analytical solution of the helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te QWs. We review both the fabrication of the sample and the experimental setup. For thin QWs with well width  d QW {\textless}6.3 nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker QWs ( d QW {\textgreater}6.3 nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to 2 e 2 / h . The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness,  d c =6.3 nm, is also independently determined from the occurrence of a magnetic field induced insulator to metal transition.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

In modern spintronics, CSC is widely used to control the novel properties of materials and generate new functionalities of devices, due to the fact that the electrical operation is still the most efficient method to control various spintronic devices and compatible with modern technologies of electronics. The efficiency of CSC is in principle determined by the material property and the device structure; therefore tremendous efforts are put to explore new materials and new architectures. The 2D systems can serve as ideal material platforms to generate high-speed, high-density, and low-cost spintronic devices, due to their exotic spin properties. The CSC effect in 2D systems has been becoming one of the most emerging research fields of spintronics.},

	abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry1,2,3. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter4,5, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon6,7) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective ‘speed of light’ c* ≈ 106 m s-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

Here, we give an extensive review of recent progress on synthetic methods and C–F bonding; additionally, we present the optical, electrical and electronic properties of fluorinated graphene and its electrochemical/biological applications. Fluorinated graphene exhibits various types of C–F bonds (covalent, semi-ionic, and ionic bonds), tunable F/C ratios, and different configurations controlled by synthetic methods including direct fluorination and exfoliation methods. The relationship between the types/amounts of C–F bonds and specific properties, such as opened bandgap, high thermal and chemical stability, dispersibility, semiconducting/insulating nature, magnetic, self-lubricating and mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, is discussed comprehensively. By optimizing the C–F bonding character and F/C ratios, fluorinated graphene can be utilized for energy conversion and storage devices, bioapplications, electrochemical sensors and amphiphobicity. Based on current progress, we propose potential problems of fluorinated graphene as well as the future challenge on the synthetic methods and C-F bonding character. This review will provide guidance for controlling C–F bonds, developing fluorine-related effects and promoting the application of fluorinated graphene.},

	abstract = {Two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D-hBN), an isomorph of graphene with a very similar layered structure, is uniquely featured by its exotic opto-electrical properties together with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. It is thus extensively studied for application in field effect transistors (FETs), tunneling devices, deep UV emitters and detectors, photoelectric devices, and nanofillers. 2D-hBN is considered as one of the most promising materials that can be integrated with other 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), for the next generation microelectronic and other technologies. Although it is by itself an insulator, it can well be tuned by several strategies in terms of properties and functionalities, such as by doping, substitution, functionalization and hybridization, making 2D-hBN a truly versatile type of functional materials for a wide range of applications. In this review, the distinct structural characteristics of 2D-hBN, doping- and defect-induced variations in energy bands and structures, and resultant properties, are presented. There are a wide variety of processing routes that have been developed for 2D-hBN, including also those for doping, substitution, functionalization and combination with other materials to form heterostructures or h-BNC hybrid nanosheets, which are systematically elaborated for novel functions. The comprehensive overview provides the types of the state-of-the-art 2D-hBN made by new synthesis strategies, where the mainstream approaches include exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and gas phase epitaxy, together with several other new methods that have been successfully developed in the past few years. On the basis of the extraordinary electrical and functional properties and thermal–mechanical stability, the applications of hBN-based nanosheets as substrates and dielectrics, passivation layers, and nanofillers in nanodevices and nanocomposites are discussed, together with the peculiar optical and wetting characteristics.},

Compared to 3D Dirac semimetals which fall into two distinct classes, Dirac semimetals in 2D with combined time-reversal and inversion symmetries belong to a single class which is closely related to the nonsymmorphic space-group symmetries. We further provide a concrete model in antiferromagnetic semimetals which supports symmetry-protected 2D Dirac points. The symmetry breaking in such systems leads to 2D chiral topological states such as quantum anomalous Hall insulator and chiral topological superconductor phases.},

Optical transitions between Landau levels (LLs) were observed in the antiferromagnetic states of these two parent compounds. Our observation of a √B dependence of the LL transition energies, the zero-energy intercepts at B=0 T under the linear extrapolations of the transition energies and the energy ratio (∼2.4) between the observed LL transitions, combined with the linear band dispersions in two-dimensional (2D) momentum space obtained by theoretical calculations, demonstrates the existence of massless Dirac fermions in the antiferromagnet BaFe2As2. More importantly, the observed dominance of the zeroth-LL-related absorption features and the calculated bands with extremely weak dispersions along the momentum direction kz indicate that massless Dirac fermions in BaFe2As2 are 2D. Furthermore, we find that the total substitution of the barium atoms in BaFe2As2 by strontium atoms not only maintains 2D massless Dirac fermions in this system, but also enhances their Fermi velocity, which supports that the Dirac points in iron-arsenide parent compounds are topologically protected.},

So far, all of the experimentally identified topologically nontrivial Dirac semimetals (DSMs) possess both parity and time reversal symmetry. The realization of magnetic topological DSMs remains a major issue in topological material research. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, it is ascertained that band inversion induces a topologically nontrivial ground state in EuCd2As2. As a result, ideal magnetic Dirac fermions with simplest double cone structure near the Fermi level emerge in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase. The magnetic order breaks time reversal symmetry, but preserves inversion symmetry. The double degeneracy of the Dirac bands is protected by a combination of inversion, time-reversal, and an additional translation operation. Moreover, the calculations show that a deviation of the magnetic moments from the c-axis leads to the breaking of C3 rotation symmetry, and thus, a small bandgap opens at the Dirac point in the bulk. In this case, the system hosts a novel state containing three different types of topological insulator: axion insulator, AFM topological crystalline insulator (TCI), and higher order topological insulator. The results provide an enlarged platform for the quest of topological Dirac fermions in a magnetic system.},

	abstract = {We used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic properties of MnBi2Te4, a material that was predicted to be an intrinsic antiferromagnetic (AFM) topological insulator. In striking contrast to earlier literature showing a full gap opening between two surface band manifolds on the (0001) surface, we observed a gapless Dirac surface state with a Dirac point sitting at EB=−280meV. Furthermore, our ARPES data revealed the existence of a second Dirac cone sitting closer to the Fermi level. Surprisingly, these surface states remain intact across the AFM transition. The presence of gapless Dirac states in this material may be caused by different ordering at the surface from the bulk or weaker magnetic coupling between the bulk and surface. Whereas the surface Dirac cones seem to be remarkably insensitive to the AFM ordering most likely due to weak coupling to magnetism, we did observe a splitting of the bulk band accompanying the AFM transition. With a moderately high ordering temperature and interesting gapless Dirac surface states, MnBi2Te4 provides a unique platform for studying the interplay between magnetic ordering and topology.},

Allowing for staggered exchange field enables quantum anomalous Hall effect in flat graphene with Chern number C=1. We explicitly show edge states in zigzag and armchair nanoribbons and explore their localization behavior. Remarkably, the combination of staggered intrinsic spin-orbit and uniform exchange coupling gives topologically protected (unlike in time-reversal systems) pseudohelical states, whose spin is opposite in opposite zigzag edges. Rotating the magnetization from out of plane to in plane makes the system trivial, allowing us to control topological phase transitions.

Although graphene by itself is nonmagnetic and it has negligible spin-orbit coupling (SOC), both of which are required for the SOT phenomenon, Cr\$\_2\$Ge\$\_2\$Te\$\_6\$ induces proximity magnetism into graphene while WS\$\_2\$ concurrently imprints valley-Zeeman and Rashba SOCs in it. Unlike SOT on conventional metallic ferromagnets brought into contact with normal materials supplying strong SOC, the predicted SOT on such doubly proximitized graphene can be tuned by up to two orders of magnitude via combined top and back electrostatic gates. The vdW heterostructure also reveals how damping-like component of the SOT vector can arise purely from interfaces and, therefore, even in the absence of any spin Hall current from the bulk of a material with strong SOC. The SOT-driven dynamics of proximity magnetization moves it from out-of-plane to in-plane direction which opens a gap in graphene and leads to zero off current and diverging on/off ratio in such SOT field-effect transistor.},

However, it is only in the last century that the concept of spin, as a pure quantum phenomenon, was established, paving the way for new applications exploiting its quantum mechanical properties. This chapter introduces the underlying mechanisms behind spin ordering in magnetic materials, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) limit, and reviews historical milestones in the development of “spintronics” and electronic devices utilizing spin. Initially studied for fundamental physical interest, spintronic applications quickly came to prominence following the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and the rediscovery of tunneling magnetoresistance in metallic architectures. The desire to integrate these phenomena with the existing semiconductor-based technologies used in the computing industry has inspired intensive study of spintronics within semiconductor materials. Notable developments include the spin field-effect transistor and nonlocal device geometries. Following the discovery of novel electronic properties of graphene, there has been a drive to harness similar properties–with the addition of spin-control–in van der Waals or 2D materials, resulting in several families of 2D magnetic materials known today.},

	abstract = {We show that inversion symmetry breaking together with spin-orbit coupling leads to coupled spin and valley physics in monolayers of MoS2 and other group-VI dichalcogenides, making possible controls of spin and valley in these 2D materials. The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries. The physics discussed here provides a route towards the integration of valleytronics and spintronics in multivalley materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking.},

Initially, we will outline the different chemical classes of 2D materials and discuss the various strategies to prepare single-layer, few-layer, and multilayer assembly materials in solution, on substrates, and on the wafer scale. Additionally, we present an experimental guide for identifying and characterizing single-layer-thick materials, as well as outlining emerging techniques that yield both local and global information. We describe the differences that occur in the electronic structure between the bulk and the single layer and discuss various methods of tuning their electronic properties by manipulating the surface. Finally, we highlight the properties and advantages of single-, few-, and many-layer 2D materials in field-effect transistors, spin- and valley-tronics, thermoelectrics, and topological insulators, among many other applications.},

Our results unveil that VX2 monolayers exhibit exciting ferromagnetic behavior, offering evidence of the existence of magnetic behavior in pristine 2D monolayers. Furthermore, interestingly, both the magnetic moments and strength of magnetic coupling increase rapidly with increasing isotropic strain from −5\% to 5\% for VX2 monolayers. It is proposed that the strain-dependent magnetic moment is related to the strong ionic–covalent bonds, while both the ferromagnetism and the variation in strength of magnetic coupling with strain arise from the combined effects of both through-bond and through-space interactions. These findings suggest a new route to facilitate the design of nanoelectronic devices for complementing graphene.},

	abstract = {Quantum systems in confined geometries are host to novel physical phenomena. Examples include quantum Hall systems in semiconductors and Dirac electrons in graphene. Interest in such systems has also been intensified by the recent discovery of a large enhancement in photoluminescence quantum efficiency and a potential route to valleytronics in atomically thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te), which are closely related to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition in monolayers. Here, we report the first direct observation of the transition from indirect to direct bandgap in monolayer samples by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on high-quality thin films of MoSe2 with variable thickness, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The band structure measured experimentally indicates a stronger tendency of monolayer MoSe2 towards a direct bandgap, as well as a larger gap size, than theoretically predicted. Moreover, our finding of a significant spin-splitting of ∼180 meV at the valence band maximum of a monolayer MoSe2 film could expand its possible application to spintronic devices.},
