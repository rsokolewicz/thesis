 abstract = {The understanding of the structural and thermal properties of membranes, low-dimensional flexible systems in a space of higher dimension, is pursued in many fields from string theory to chemistry and biology. The case of a two-dimensional (2D) membrane in three dimensions is the relevant one for dealing with real materials. Traditionally, membranes are primarily discussed in the context of biological membranes and soft matter in general. The complexity of these systems hindered a realistic description of their interatomic structures based on a truly microscopic approach. Therefore, theories of membranes were developed mostly within phenomenological models. From the point of view of statistical mechanics, membranes at finite temperature are systems governed by interacting long-range fluctuations.Graphene, the first truly two-dimensional system consisting of just one layer of carbon atoms, provides a model system for the development of a microscopic description of membranes. In the same way that geneticists have used Drosophila as a gateway to probe more complex questions, theoretical chemists and physicists can use graphene as a simple model membrane to study both phenomenological theories and experiments. In this Account, we review key results in the microscopic theory of structural and thermal properties of graphene and compare them with the predictions of phenomenological theories. The two approaches are in good agreement for the various scaling properties of correlation functions of atomic displacements. However, some other properties, such as the temperature dependence of the bending rigidity, cannot be understood based on phenomenological approaches. We also consider graphene at very high temperature and compare the results with existing models for two-dimensional melting. The melting of graphene presents a different scenario, and we describe that process as the decomposition of the graphene layer into entangled carbon chains.},

 abstract = {Carbon is one of the most intriguing elements in the Periodic Table. It forms many allotropes, some known from ancient times (diamond and graphite) and some discovered 10-20 years ago (fullerenes and nanotubes). Interestingly, the two-dimensional form (graphene) was only obtained very recently, immediately attracting a great deal of attention. Electrons in graphene, obeying a linear dispersion relation, behave like massless relativistic particles. This results in the observation of a number of very peculiar electronic properties -- from an anomalous quantum Hall effect to the absence of localization -- in this, the first two-dimensional material. It also provides a bridge between condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics, and opens new perspectives for carbon-based electronics.},

 abstract = {Single- or multi-layer transition metal oxides (TMOs) have a relatively longer history than other atomically thin materials. TMOs comprise many earth-abundant minerals and have been used for millenia as construction materials, pigments, lubricants, for heat management and many other applications. In TMOs, the transition metal s electrons are strongly pulled by oxygen, and consequently the structural, physical and chemical properties are mostly determined by the strongly correlated d electrons. TMOs are also highly tunable owing to the diversity of their chemical composition, crystal structure and relative ease in inducing oxygen defects. Two dimensional (2D) TMOs often show different physical and chemical properties in comparison to their bulk counterparts. These differences give rise to a variety of remarkable electronic properties such as high temperature superconductivity and multiferroicity and also unique optical, mechanical and thermal phenomena. Additionally, reducing the thickness of TMOs can alter their catalytic and chemical characteristics. Despite their unique properties, single- and few-layer TMOs have received relatively little attention compared to other recent families of atomically thin materials such as layered transition metal dichalcogenides. The overarching aim of this review is to bring the unique aspects of TMOs to the attention of the research community to establish a strong future for research on 2D and layered TMOs. In this review, a comprehensive overview regarding 2D and layered TMOs will be presented. The fundamentals and applications of planar TMOs are discussed. The manuscript will also present future prospects and pathways to new developments that are offered by such TMOs.},

 abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest because of their large surface-to-volume ratios and electron confinement. Compared to common 2D materials such as graphene or metal hydroxides, with their intrinsic layered atomic structures, the formation mechanisms of 2D metal oxides with a rocksalt structure are not well understood. Here, we report the formation process for 2D cobalt oxide and cobalt nickel oxide nanosheets, after analysis by in situ liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticles are initially formed from the molecular precursor solution and then transform into 2D nanosheets. Ab initio calculations show that a small nanocrystal is dominated by positive edge energy, but when it grows to a certain size, the negative surface energy becomes dominant, driving the transformation of the 3D nanocrystal into a 2D structure. Uncovering these growth pathways, including the 3D-to-2D transition, provides opportunities for future material design and synthesis in solution.},

 abstract = {Na2Co2TeO6 has recently been proposed to be a Kitaev-like honeycomb magnet. To assess how close it is to realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquids, we have measured magnetization and specific heat on high-quality single crystals in magnetic fields applied along high-symmetry directions. Small training fields reveal a weak but canonical ferrimagnetic behavior below 27 K, which suggests that the previously established zigzag antiferromagnetic order, with collinear moments pointing along the zigzag chains, must be supplemented by q=0 (e.g., N\'eel type in the absence of structural modulations) moment canting. Moderate fields in the honeycomb plane suppress the thermal transition at 27 K, and seem to partly reverse the moment canting when applied perpendicular to the zigzag chains. In contrast, out-of-plane fields leave the transition largely unaffected, but promotes another transition below 10 K, possibly also related to canting reversal. The magnetism in Na2Co2TeO6 is highly anisotropic and close to tipping points between competing phases.},

 abstract = {We report that two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets have been successfully synthesized using the electrolysis of nickel plate as the anode in deionized water. The electrolysis processes first produced 2D nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) nanosheets, which were transformed to 2D NiO by calcination. Contrary to the classical crystallization mechanism, contiguous SEM observations revealed that the Ni(OH)2 were produced via a multistep oriented attachment (MOA) mode, in which the [Ni(OH)6]4$-$ coordination octahedron serves as the building block. Hydrothermal experiments further showed that the technique can be applied to the synthesis of 3D Ni(OH)2 nanoflowers with the aid of introduced Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. A growth mechanism based on the selective-surface adsorption and intercalation of nitrate ions (NO3$-$) and hydroxyl ions (OH$-$) as well as the adsorption of free ammonia molecules (NH3), was proposed. The crystal morphologies and thickness can be controlled by a charging magnetic field, suggesting that the crystal growth mechanisms are dominated by micromechanics such as the magnetic dipole force, Van der Waals force and magnetic force.},

 abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials displaying spontaneous polarizations are promising candidates for miniaturized electronic and memory devices. However, stable FE orderings are only found in a small number of 2D materials by experiment so far. In the current work, based on high-throughput screening of a 2D van der Waals layered materials database and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate niobium oxide dihalides NbOX2 (X = Cl, Br and I), a group of experimentally synthesized yet underexplored van der Waals layered compounds, as a new family of 2D materials that simultaneously exhibit intrinsic in-plane ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity. Similar to FE perovskite oxides, polar displacement of Nb cations relative to the center of the anion octahedral cage can lead to experimentally measurable FE polarizations up to 27 $\mu$C cm-2 in layered NbOX2. The presence of low-lying antiferroelectric (AFE) phases can effectively reduce the energy barrier associated with polarization switching, suggesting switchable ferroelectricity is experimentally achievable. In addition, the mechanism driving FE phase transitions in NbOX2 monolayers around Curie temperature TC is clearly revealed by our finite-temperature simulations. NbOCl2 monolayer is predicted to be a stable ferroelectric with TC above room temperature. Moreover, application of NbOBr2 and NbOI2 monolayers as 2D dielectric capacitors is further developed, where electrostatic energy storage of nearly 100},

These molecularly thin layers are expected to present unique properties with respect to the bulk counterpart, due to increased lattice deformations caused by interface strain. Here, we have synthesized centimetre-sized, pure-phase single-crystal RPP perovskites (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n$-$1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1--4) from which single quantum well layers have been exfoliated. We observed a reversible shift in excitonic energies induced by laser annealing on exfoliated layers encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. Moreover, a highly efficient photodetector was fabricated using a molecularly thin n = 4 RPP crystal, showing a photogain of 105 and an internal quantum efficiency of {\textasciitilde }34\%. Our results suggest that, thanks to their dynamic structure, atomically thin perovskites enable an additional degree of control for the bandgap engineering of these materials},

 abstract = {The unique hybrid nature of 2D Ruddlesden--Popper (R--P) perovskites has bestowed upon them not only tunability of their electronic properties but also high-performance electronic devices with improved environmental stability as compared to their 3D analogs. However, there is limited information about their inherent heat, light, and air stability and how different parameters such as the inorganic layer number and length of organic spacer molecule affect stability. To gain deeper understanding on the matter we have expanded the family of 2D R--P perovskites, by utilizing pentylamine (PA)2(MA)n$-$1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1--5, PA = CH3(CH2)4NH3+, C5) and hexylamine (HA)2(MA)n$-$1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1--4, HA = CH3(CH2)5NH3+, C6) as the organic spacer molecules between the inorganic slabs, creating two new series of layered materials, for up to n = 5 and 4 layers, respectively. The resulting compounds were extensively characterized through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods, including single crystal X-ray analysis. High resolution powder X-ray diffraction studies using synchrotron radiation shed light for the first time to the phase transitions of the higher layer 2D R--P perovskites. The increase in the length of the organic spacer molecules did not affect their optical properties; however, it has a pronounced effect on the air, heat, and light stability of the fabricated thin films. An extensive study of heat, light, and air stability with and without encapsulation revealed that specific compounds can be air stable (relative humidity (RH) = 20--80\% $\pm$ 5\%) for more than 450 days, while heat and light stability in air can be exponentially increased by encapsulating the corresponding films. Evaluation of the out-of-plane mechanical properties of the corresponding materials showed that their soft and flexible nature can be compared to current commercially available polymer substrates (e.g., PMMA), rendering them suitable for fabricating flexible and wearable electronic devices.},

We find that the CoBr3 monolayer is an intrinsic two-dimensional ferromagnetic material with a Curie temperature Tc = 264 K predicted from Monte Carlo simulations. The phonon spectra analysis indicates that the CoBr3 monolayer is dynamically stable. Taking into account spin--orbit coupling, this makes the electronic structure of the CoBr3 monolayer topologically non-trivial with a global band gap of 8.7 meV. The anomalous Hall conductivity calculation shows a Chern number C = 2, meaning the presence of a two edge state in nanoribbons of finite width. These findings not only add an experimentally feasible member to the quantum anomalous Hall insulator family, but also pave the way for highly promising application potentials in nanoelectronics and spintronics.},

Graphene is one of them and attracts interest because of its weak spin--orbit interaction, the ability to control electronic properties by the electric field effect and the possibility to introduce paramagnetic centres such as vacancies and adatoms. Here we show that the magnetism of adatoms in graphene is itinerant and can be controlled by doping, so that magnetic moments are switched on and off. The much-discussed vacancy magnetism is found to have a dual origin, with two approximately equal contributions; one from itinerant magnetism and the other from dangling bonds. Our work suggests that graphene's spin transport can be controlled by the field effect, similar to its electronic and optical properties, and that spin diffusion can be significantly enhanced above a certain carrier density.},

Migration of hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl groups on the surface of graphene during the delamination of HOPG led to the formation of seven atom or seven OH-group clusters with S = 5/2 that were of a special interest. The coincidence of symmetry of the clusters with the graphene lattice strengthens the stability of the cluster. For (OH)7 clusters that were situated greater than 3 nm from one another, the reconstruction barrier to a nonmagnetic configuration was approximately 0.4 eV, whereas for H7 clusters, there was no barrier and the high-spin state was unstable. Stability of the high-spin clusters increased if they were formed on top of ripples. Exchange interactions between the clusters were studied and we have shown that the ferromagnetic state is improbable. The role of the chemical composition of the solvent used for the delamination of graphite is discussed.},

 abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry1,2,3. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter4,5, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon6,7) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective `speed of light' c* $\approx$ 106 m s-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

 abstract = {Spin electronics is a rapidly expanding field stimulated by a strong synergy between breakthrough basic research discoveries and industrial applications in the fields of magnetic recording, magnetic field sensors, nonvolatile memories [magnetic random access memories (MRAM) and especially spin-transfer-torque MRAM (STT-MRAM)]. In addition to the discovery of several physical phenomena (giant magnetoresistance, tunnel magnetoresistance, spin-transfer torque, spin-orbit torque, spin Hall effect, spin Seebeck effect, etc.), outstanding progress has been made on the growth and nanopatterning of magnetic multilayered films and nanostructures in which these phenomena are observed. Magnetic anisotropy is usually observed in materials that have large spin-orbit interactions. However, in 2002 perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) was discovered to exist at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces [for instance Co(Fe)/alumina]. Surprisingly, this PMA is observed in systems where spin-orbit interactions are quite weak, but its amplitude is remarkably large---comparable to that measured at Co/Pt interfaces, a reference for large interfacial anisotropy (anisotropy$\sim$1.4 erg/cm2=1.4 mJ/m2). Actually, this PMA was found to be very common at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces since it has been observed with a large variety of amorphous or crystalline oxides, including AlOx, MgO, TaOx, HfOx, etc. This PMA is thought to be the result of electronic hybridization between the oxygen and the magnetic transition metal orbit across the interface, a hypothesis supported by ab initio calculations. Interest in this phenomenon was sparked in 2010 when it was demonstrated that the PMA at magnetic transition metal/oxide interfaces could be used to build out-of-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions for STT-MRAM cells. In these systems, the PMA at the CoFeB/MgO interface can be used to simultaneously obtain good memory retention, thanks to the large PMA amplitude, and a low write current, thanks to a relatively weak Gilbert damping. These two requirements for memories tend to be difficult to reconcile since they rely on the same spin-orbit coupling. PMA-based approaches have now become ubiquitous in the designs for perpendicular STT-MRAM, and major microelectronics companies are actively working on their development with the first goal of addressing embedded FLASH and static random access memory-type of applications. Scalability of STT-MRAM devices based on this interfacial PMA is expected to soon exceed the 20-nm nodes. Several very active new fields of research also rely on interfacial PMA at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces, including spin-orbit torques associated with Rashba or spin Hall effects, record high speed domain wall propagation in buffer/magnetic metal/oxide-based magnetic wires, and voltage-based control of anisotropy. This review deals with PMA at magnetic metal/oxide interfaces from its discovery, by examining the diversity of systems in which it has been observed and the physicochemical methods through which the key roles played by the electronic hybridization at the metal/oxide interface were elucidated. The physical origins of the phenomenon are also covered and how these are supported by ab initio calculations is dealt with. Finally, some examples of applications of this interfacial PMA in STT-MRAM are listed along with the various emerging research topics taking advantage of this PMA.},

These equations capture a number of interrelated effects including spin accumulation and diffusion, Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation, magnetoelectric, and spin-galvanic effects. They can be used under very general circumstances to model transport experiments in 2DEG systems that involve either electrical or optical spin injection. We comment on the relationship between these equations and the exact spin and charge density operator equations of motion. As an example of the application of our equations, we consider a simple electrical spin injection experiment and show that a voltage will develop between two ferromagnetic contacts if a spin-polarized current is injected into a 2DEG, that depends on the relative magnetization orientation of the contacts. This voltage is present even when the separation between the contacts is larger than the spin diffusion length.},

 abstract = {This chapter is concerned with spin-resonance absorption---that is, power absorption from an oscillating magnetic field---by conduction electrons. The e place of spin resonance in investigations of the band structure contrasts the cases of paramagnetic salts and conductors. In the former, the levels of the ions are discrete; when they have an odd number of electrons each level is at least twofold degenerate. An external magnetic field splits this degeneracy. The microwave spectroscopy of the energy bands is not confined to spin resonance, but includes cyclotron resonance. Of the two, undoubtedly the latter provides the most direct information on the energy bands. Spin resonance does not play the central role that it does in paramagnetic salts. However, it usually plays a useful supplementary role when something about the band structure is known, serving either as a check on the band model or determining the values of additional parameters. The use of spin resonance in semiconductors and semimetals grow as better materials are made and detailed knowledge about their band structure becomes available.},

However, to use 2D vdW magnets for building spintronic nanodevices such as magnetic memories, key challenges remain in terms of effectively switching the magnetization from one state to the other electrically. Here, we devise a bilayer structure of Fe3GeTe2/Pt, in which the magnetization of few-layered Fe3GeTe2 can be effectively switched by the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the current flowing in the Pt layer. The effective magnetic fields corresponding to the SOTs are further quantitatively characterized using harmonic measurements. Our demonstration of the SOT-driven magnetization switching in a 2D vdW magnet could pave the way for implementing low-dimensional materials in the next-generation spintronic applications. Spin-orbit torque flips the perpendicular magnetic moment of a 2D van der Waals magnet. Spin-orbit torque flips the perpendicular magnetic moment of a 2D van der Waals magnet.},

The antisymmetric spin coupling suggested by Dzialoshinski from purely symmetry grounds and the symmetric pseudodipolar interaction are derived. Their orders of magnitudes are estimated to be ($\Delta$gg) and ($\Delta$gg)2 times the isotropic superexchange energy, respectively. Higher order spin couplings are also discussed. As an example of antisymmetric spin coupling the case of CuCl2$\cdot$2H2O is illustrated. In CuCl2$\cdot$2H2O, a spin arrangement which is different from one accepted so far is proposed. This antisymmetric interaction is shown to be responsible for weak ferromagnetism in $\alpha$-Fe2O3, MnCO3, and CrF3. The paramagnetic susceptibility perpendicular to the trigonal axis is expected to increase very sharply near the N\'eel temperature as the temperature is lowered, as was actually observed in CrF3.},

For a generalized two-dimensional Rashba ferromagnet, we present a microscopic analysis of this contribution and, in particular, demonstrate that it cannot be expressed through Lifshitz invariants beyond the linear order in the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. Terms in wch beyond Lifshitz invariants emerge as a result of spin rotation symmetry breaking caused by SOC. The effects of these terms on the phase diagram of magnetic states and spin-wave dispersion are discussed. Finally, we present a classification of terms in wch, allowed by symmetry, for each crystallographic point group.},

This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

 abstract = {Using electrical characteristics from three-terminal field-effect transistors (FETs), we demonstrate substantial strain induced band gap tunability in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in line with theoretical predictions and optical experiments. Devices were fabricated on flexible substrates, and a cantilever sample holder was used to apply uniaxial tensile strain to the various multilayer TMD FETs. Analyzing in particular transfer characteristics, we argue that the modified device characteristics under strain are clear evidence of a band gap reduction of 100 meV in WSe2 under 1.35\% uniaxial tensile strain at room temperature. Furthermore, the obtained device characteristics imply that the band gap does not shrink uniformly under strain relative to a reference potential defined by the source/drain contacts. Instead, the band gap change is only related to a change of the conduction band edge of WSe2, resulting in a decrease in the Schottky barrier (SB) for electrons without any change for hole injection into the valence band. Simulations of SB device characteristics are employed to explain this point and to quantify our findings. Last, our experimental results are compared with DFT calculations under strain showing excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and the experimental data presented here.},

Our ab initio calculations show that this class of compounds includes wide and narrow gap semiconductors, metals, and half-metals, and that most of these compounds are magnetic. Although antiferromagnetic order is most common, ferromagnetism is predicted in MSiSe3 for M = Mn and Ni; in MSiTe3 for M = V and Ni; in MnGeSe3; MGeTe3 for M = Cr, Mn, and Ni; in FeSnS3; and in MSnTe3 for M = V, Mn, and Fe. Among these compounds CrGeTe3,VSnTe3, and CrSnTe3 are ferromagnetic semiconductors. Our calculations suggest that the competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order can be substantially altered by strain engineering, and in the semiconductor case also by gating. The associated critical temperatures can be enhanced by means of carrier doping and strains.},

 abstract = {The search for topologically non-trivial states of matter has become an important goal for condensed matter physics. Recently, a new class of topological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic field. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells (QWs). By varying the thickness of the QW, the band structure changes from a normal to an ``inverted'' type at a critical thickness d c . We present an analytical solution of the helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te QWs. We review both the fabrication of the sample and the experimental setup. For thin QWs with well width d QW {\textless }6.3 nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker QWs ( d QW {\textgreater }6.3 nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to 2 e 2 / h . The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d c =6.3 nm, is also independently determined from the occurrence of a magnetic field induced insulator to metal transition.},

In modern spintronics, CSC is widely used to control the novel properties of materials and generate new functionalities of devices, due to the fact that the electrical operation is still the most efficient method to control various spintronic devices and compatible with modern technologies of electronics. The efficiency of CSC is in principle determined by the material property and the device structure; therefore tremendous efforts are put to explore new materials and new architectures. The 2D systems can serve as ideal material platforms to generate high-speed, high-density, and low-cost spintronic devices, due to their exotic spin properties.

 abstract = {Fluorinated graphene, an up-rising member of the graphene family, combines a two-dimensional layer-structure, a wide bandgap, and high stability and attracts significant attention because of its unique nanostructure and carbon--fluorine bonds. Here, we give an extensive review of recent progress on synthetic methods and C--F bonding; additionally, we present the optical, electrical and electronic properties of fluorinated graphene and its electrochemical/biological applications. Fluorinated graphene exhibits various types of C--F bonds (covalent, semi-ionic, and ionic bonds), tunable F/C ratios, and different configurations controlled by synthetic methods including direct fluorination and exfoliation methods. The relationship between the types/amounts of C--F bonds and specific properties, such as opened bandgap, high thermal and chemical stability, dispersibility, semiconducting/insulating nature, magnetic, self-lubricating and mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, is discussed comprehensively. By optimizing the C--F bonding character and F/C ratios, fluorinated graphene can be utilized for energy conversion and storage devices, bioapplications, electrochemical sensors and amphiphobicity. Based on current progress, we propose potential problems of fluorinated graphene as well as the future challenge on the synthetic methods and C-F bonding character. This review will provide guidance for controlling C--F bonds, developing fluorine-related effects and promoting the application of fluorinated graphene.},

 abstract = {Two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D-hBN), an isomorph of graphene with a very similar layered structure, is uniquely featured by its exotic opto-electrical properties together with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. It is thus extensively studied for application in field effect transistors (FETs), tunneling devices, deep UV emitters and detectors, photoelectric devices, and nanofillers. 2D-hBN is considered as one of the most promising materials that can be integrated with other 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), for the next generation microelectronic and other technologies. Although it is by itself an insulator, it can well be tuned by several strategies in terms of properties and functionalities, such as by doping, substitution, functionalization and hybridization, making 2D-hBN a truly versatile type of functional materials for a wide range of applications. In this review, the distinct structural characteristics of 2D-hBN, doping- and defect-induced variations in energy bands and structures, and resultant properties, are presented. There are a wide variety of processing routes that have been developed for 2D-hBN, including also those for doping, substitution, functionalization and combination with other materials to form heterostructures or h-BNC hybrid nanosheets, which are systematically elaborated for novel functions. The comprehensive overview provides the types of the state-of-the-art 2D-hBN made by new synthesis strategies, where the mainstream approaches include exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and gas phase epitaxy, together with several other new methods that have been successfully developed in the past few years. On the basis of the extraordinary electrical and functional properties and thermal--mechanical stability, the applications of hBN-based nanosheets as substrates and dielectrics, passivation layers, and nanofillers in nanodevices and nanocomposites are discussed, together with the peculiar optical and wetting characteristics.},

The 2D Dirac cones are protected by crystalline symmetries and magnetic ordering may destroy their robustness. Here we propose a general framework to classify stable 2D Dirac semimetals in spin-orbit coupled systems having the combined time-reversal and inversion symmetries, and show the existence of the stable Dirac points in 2D antiferromagnetic semimetals. Compared to 3D Dirac semimetals which fall into two distinct classes, Dirac semimetals in 2D with combined time-reversal and inversion symmetries belong to a single class which is closely related to the nonsymmorphic space-group symmetries. We further provide a concrete model in antiferromagnetic semimetals which supports symmetry-protected 2D Dirac points. The symmetry breaking in such systems leads to 2D chiral topological states such as quantum anomalous Hall insulator and chiral topological superconductor phases.},

These MXenes are either metallic or semiconducting, whereas Dirac cones similar to graphene have rarely been reported. Using first-principles calculations, we proposed a new MXene, namely Zr2Si, whose antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state exhibited in these calculations anisotropic Dirac cones with Fermi velocities comparable to that in graphene. The Dirac spectrum here was determined to arise mainly from the dx2$-$y2 and dz2 orbitals of Zr atoms. Additionally, the Dirac cones can be gapped when taking the spin--orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb repulsive interaction (U) into account, which opens an avenue for using the Zr2Si MXene for electronics applications.},

Optical transitions between Landau levels (LLs) were observed in the antiferromagnetic states of these two parent compounds. Our observation of a $\surd$B dependence of the LL transition energies, the zero-energy intercepts at B=0 T under the linear extrapolations of the transition energies and the energy ratio ($\sim$2.4) between the observed LL transitions, combined with the linear band dispersions in two-dimensional (2D) momentum space obtained by theoretical calculations, demonstrates the existence of massless Dirac fermions in the antiferromagnet BaFe2As2. More importantly, the observed dominance of the zeroth-LL-related absorption features and the calculated bands with extremely weak dispersions along the momentum direction kz indicate that massless Dirac fermions in BaFe2As2 are 2D. Furthermore, we find that the total substitution of the barium atoms in BaFe2As2 by strontium atoms not only maintains 2D massless Dirac fermions in this system, but also enhances their Fermi velocity, which supports that the Dirac points in iron-arsenide parent compounds are topologically protected.},

 abstract = {Parity-time symmetry plays an essential role for the formation of Dirac states in Dirac semimetals. So far, all of the experimentally identified topologically nontrivial Dirac semimetals (DSMs) possess both parity and time reversal symmetry. The realization of magnetic topological DSMs remains a major issue in topological material research. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, it is ascertained that band inversion induces a topologically nontrivial ground state in EuCd2As2. As a result, ideal magnetic Dirac fermions with simplest double cone structure near the Fermi level emerge in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase. The magnetic order breaks time reversal symmetry, but preserves inversion symmetry. The double degeneracy of the Dirac bands is protected by a combination of inversion, time-reversal, and an additional translation operation. Moreover, the calculations show that a deviation of the magnetic moments from the c-axis leads to the breaking of C3 rotation symmetry, and thus, a small bandgap opens at the Dirac point in the bulk. In this case, the system hosts a novel state containing three different types of topological insulator: axion insulator, AFM topological crystalline insulator (TCI), and higher order topological insulator. The results provide an enlarged platform for the quest of topological Dirac fermions in a magnetic system.},

In striking contrast to earlier literature showing a full gap opening between two surface band manifolds on the (0001) surface, we observed a gapless Dirac surface state with a Dirac point sitting at EB=$-$280meV. Furthermore, our ARPES data revealed the existence of a second Dirac cone sitting closer to the Fermi level. Surprisingly, these surface states remain intact across the AFM transition. The presence of gapless Dirac states in this material may be caused by different ordering at the surface from the bulk or weaker magnetic coupling between the bulk and surface. Whereas the surface Dirac cones seem to be remarkably insensitive to the AFM ordering most likely due to weak coupling to magnetism, we did observe a splitting of the bulk band accompanying the AFM transition. With a moderately high ordering temperature and interesting gapless Dirac surface states, MnBi2Te4 provides a unique platform for studying the interplay between magnetic ordering and topology.},

We explicitly show edge states in zigzag and armchair nanoribbons and explore their localization behavior. Remarkably, the combination of staggered intrinsic spin-orbit and uniform exchange coupling gives topologically protected (unlike in time-reversal systems) pseudohelical states, whose spin is opposite in opposite zigzag edges. Rotating the magnetization from out of plane to in plane makes the system trivial, allowing us to control topological phase transitions.

 abstract = {Using first-principles combined with quantum transport calculations, we predict that graphene sandwiched between insulating monolayers of Cr\$\_2\$Ge\$\_2\$Te\$\_6\$ ferromagnet and WS\$\_2\$ transition-metal dichalcogenide will exhibit spin-orbit torque (SOT) when unpolarized charge current is injected parallel to interfaces of Cr\$\_2\$Ge\$\_2\$Te\$\_6\$/graphene/WS\$\_2\$ van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. Although graphene by itself is nonmagnetic and it has negligible spin-orbit coupling (SOC), both of which are required for the SOT phenomenon, Cr\$\_2\$Ge\$\_2\$Te\$\_6\$ induces proximity magnetism into graphene while WS\$\_2\$ concurrently imprints valley-Zeeman and Rashba SOCs in it. Unlike SOT on conventional metallic ferromagnets brought into contact with normal materials supplying strong SOC, the predicted SOT on such doubly proximitized graphene can be tuned by up to two orders of magnitude via combined top and back electrostatic gates. The vdW heterostructure also reveals how damping-like component of the SOT vector can arise purely from interfaces and, therefore, even in the absence of any spin Hall current from the bulk of a material with strong SOC. The SOT-driven dynamics of proximity magnetization moves it from out-of-plane to in-plane direction which opens a gap in graphene and leads to zero off current and diverging on/off ratio in such SOT field-effect transistor.},

 abstract = {Spin-based technologies, in the form of magnetic compasses, have existed for thousands of years. However, it is only in the last century that the concept of spin, as a pure quantum phenomenon, was established, paving the way for new applications exploiting its quantum mechanical properties. This chapter introduces the underlying mechanisms behind spin ordering in magnetic materials, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) limit, and reviews historical milestones in the development of ``spintronics'' and electronic devices utilizing spin. Initially studied for fundamental physical interest, spintronic applications quickly came to prominence following the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and the rediscovery of tunneling magnetoresistance in metallic architectures. The desire to integrate these phenomena with the existing semiconductor-based technologies used in the computing industry has inspired intensive study of spintronics within semiconductor materials. Notable developments include the spin field-effect transistor and nonlocal device geometries. Following the discovery of novel electronic properties of graphene, there has been a drive to harness similar properties--with the addition of spin-control--in van der Waals or 2D materials, resulting in several families of 2D magnetic materials known today.},

Through characterization by absorption, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity spectroscopy, we trace the effect of quantum confinement on the material's electronic structure. With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly. The freestanding monolayer exhibits an increase in luminescence quantum efficiency by more than a factor of 104 compared with the bulk material.},

 abstract = {We show that inversion symmetry breaking together with spin-orbit coupling leads to coupled spin and valley physics in monolayers of MoS2 and other group-VI dichalcogenides, making possible controls of spin and valley in these 2D materials. The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries. The physics discussed here provides a route towards the integration of valleytronics and spintronics in multivalley materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking.},

Here we review the state-of-the-art of 2D materials beyond graphene. Initially, we will outline the different chemical classes of 2D materials and discuss the various strategies to prepare single-layer, few-layer, and multilayer assembly materials in solution, on substrates, and on the wafer scale. Additionally, we present an experimental guide for identifying and characterizing single-layer-thick materials, as well as outlining emerging techniques that yield both local and global information. We describe the differences that occur in the electronic structure between the bulk and the single layer and discuss various methods of tuning their electronic properties by manipulating the surface. Finally, we highlight the properties and advantages of single-, few-, and many-layer 2D materials in field-effect transistors, spin- and valley-tronics, thermoelectrics, and topological insulators, among many other applications.},

 abstract = {First-principles calculations are performed to study the electronic and magnetic properties of VX2 monolayers (X = S, Se). Our results unveil that VX2 monolayers exhibit exciting ferromagnetic behavior, offering evidence of the existence of magnetic behavior in pristine 2D monolayers. Furthermore, interestingly, both the magnetic moments and strength of magnetic coupling increase rapidly with increasing isotropic strain from $-$5\% to 5\% for VX2 monolayers. It is proposed that the strain-dependent magnetic moment is related to the strong ionic--covalent bonds, while both the ferromagnetism and the variation in strength of magnetic coupling with strain arise from the combined effects of both through-bond and through-space interactions. These findings suggest a new route to facilitate the design of nanoelectronic devices for complementing graphene.},

 abstract = {Quantum systems in confined geometries are host to novel physical phenomena. Examples include quantum Hall systems in semiconductors and Dirac electrons in graphene. Interest in such systems has also been intensified by the recent discovery of a large enhancement in photoluminescence quantum efficiency and a potential route to valleytronics in atomically thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te), which are closely related to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition in monolayers. Here, we report the first direct observation of the transition from indirect to direct bandgap in monolayer samples by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on high-quality thin films of MoSe2 with variable thickness, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The band structure measured experimentally indicates a stronger tendency of monolayer MoSe2 towards a direct bandgap, as well as a larger gap size, than theoretically predicted. Moreover, our finding of a significant spin-splitting of $\sim$180 meV at the valence band maximum of a monolayer MoSe2 film could expand its possible application to spintronic devices.},

This review provides an overview of low-dimensional magnetism in graphene, h-BN, and carbon nitrides, which originates from defects like vacancy, adatom, doping, and dangling bonds. In transition metal dichalcogenides, a tunable magnetism comes from doping, strain, and vacancy/defects, and these materials offer spintronics, as well as photoelectronic potentials, since they have an additional degree of freedom called valley state (e.g. MoS2). Strain- and layer-dependent magnetic ordering has been observed in layered compounds like CrXTe3, CrI3, and trisulfides. The magnetism in 2D oxides like MoO3, Ni(OH)2,and perovskites are also interesting as they are potential candidates for next-generation devices having faster processing and large data storage capacity. Quasi 2D magnetism in MXene and in atomically thin materials supported on 3D materials will also be discussed. Finally, some of the challenges related to the control of defects and imperfections in 2D lattice, promising approaches to overcome them will be covered.},
